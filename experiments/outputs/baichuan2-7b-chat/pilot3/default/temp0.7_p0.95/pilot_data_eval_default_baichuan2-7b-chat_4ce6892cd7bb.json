She chose the prettiest envelope she could find, painted with colorful images of animals and flowers. But before she could seal it, she remembered something she had seen in a book at the library. It was called \"The Art of Letter Stamping\" and told how to make the process of sending a letter more artistic and memorable.So, Elsa took out a collection of stamps from her father's old collection. Some were small and square, others were round and large. She chose one with a beautiful painting of a river on it. Then, she carefully applied each stamp to the letter, making sure they were evenly distributed so that the design would look even and beautiful. When she was done, she couldn't wait to see her grandma's face when she opened the envelope and saw all the artful stamps. As the letter was sent off into the world, a new tradition was born - letters stamped with beauty and creativity.",
