Dr. Helena Reyes traced her fingertips along the rust-covered walls, knowing that each step deeper into the gloom might reveal the mechanical marvel she had researched for decades. The payment for her lifelong obsession would be understanding the cryptic engineering of a civilization that predated known human history. Gears larger than carriage wheels lay silent and dusty, their intricate teeth suggesting a complexity that defied contemporary scientific understanding. As her lantern flickered, revealing glimpses of impossible machinery, Helena realized she was about to unravel a mystery that would rewrite everything humanity thought it knew about technological evolution.",
