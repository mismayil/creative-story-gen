Her laughter was pure diesel, powerful and long-lasting, igniting smiles in even the gloomiest of souls. But as she gave and gave, Lila found her own reserves running dangerously low, her once-boundless spirit sputtering like an engine on fumes. It wasn't until she met Zane, whose kindness acted as a cosmic refinery, that she learned the art of replenishing her own emotional tank. Together, they created a perpetual energy loop, their combined compassion powering not just themselves, but radiating outward to fuel the happiness of an entire city.",

Aria hesitated, her heart pounding as she wrestled with the decision to leave everything behind or comply with the suffocating expectations that had defined her life thus far.
