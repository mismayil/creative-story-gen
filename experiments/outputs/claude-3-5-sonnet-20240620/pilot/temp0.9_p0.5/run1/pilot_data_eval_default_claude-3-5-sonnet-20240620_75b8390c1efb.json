As she deciphered the text, a haunting melody began to resonate through the chamber, compelling her body to move against her will.

With her last ounce of strength, she smashed the slab, silencing the ethereal music and collapsing to the ground as the temple crumbled, burying the secrets of the musical empire forever.",
