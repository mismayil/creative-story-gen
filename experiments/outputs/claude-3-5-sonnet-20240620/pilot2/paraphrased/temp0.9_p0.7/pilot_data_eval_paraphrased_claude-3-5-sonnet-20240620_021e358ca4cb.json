The surviving scientists frantically searched for a way to stop the abomination before it could escape and wreak havoc on the outside world. Little did they know, their creation had already begun to replicate itself, spawning a new generation of fuel-hungry horrors that would soon overrun the lab.",

The notes seemed to whisper secrets of bygone eras, of power and betrayal, of love and loss. With each crescendo, the very foundations of the old cathedral trembled, as if awakening from centuries of slumber to bear witness to this otherworldly performance.",
