In their attempt to understand human culture, they beamed down a team to investigate, materializing inside a bustling restaurant kitchen during the dinner rush. Chaos ensued as chefs and servers alike screamed in terror, flinging pots, pans, and food in all directions while fleeing the bewildered aliens. The visitors, covered in various sauces and ingredients, decided that perhaps studying humans from afar might be a safer approach to satisfying their curiosity.",
