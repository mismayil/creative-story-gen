The fragile paper, once thought to be a mere scrap, revealed a map to a long-lost civilization. With trembling fingers, she carefully unfolded the delicate document, her eyes widening as she deciphered the intricate symbols that seemed to write themselves across the page. Suddenly, a blinding light engulfed her, and Amelia found herself transported to a bustling marketplace in a city that shouldn't exist. Overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of this impossible place, she clutched the map to her chest, knowing that her adventure had only just begun.",
