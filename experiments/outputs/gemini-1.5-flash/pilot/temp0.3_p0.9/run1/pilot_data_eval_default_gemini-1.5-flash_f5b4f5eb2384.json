He knew the well was running dry, the last vestiges of water a mere whisper in the depths.  His crops, once vibrant green, were now parched and brittle, their leaves curling inwards like desperate pleas.  He needed rain, a deluge to replenish the earth, to revive his farm, to save his lifeblood, his precious petrol.",
