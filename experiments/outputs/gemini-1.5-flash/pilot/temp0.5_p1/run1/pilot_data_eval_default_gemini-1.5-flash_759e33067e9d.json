The sun, a dying ember in the west, cast long shadows across the cracked stone floor, painting the organ in an eerie, golden light.  A lone figure, a descendant of the empire's forgotten lineage, stood before the organ, his heart pounding with the rhythm of a forgotten song.  He raised his hand, hesitant, then pressed a key, and the organ, with a sigh of ancient breath, began to sing.",
