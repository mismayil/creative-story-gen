A single, flickering light cast long shadows on the cracked concrete floor, illuminating the rusted pump and the lone figure hunched over it, his face etched with the weariness of a thousand lost hopes.  He poured the diesel into a battered metal bucket, a silent prayer for a future that might never come.",
