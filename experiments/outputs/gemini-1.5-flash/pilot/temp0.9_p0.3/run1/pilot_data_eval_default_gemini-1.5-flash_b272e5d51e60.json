The letter, a single sheet of parchment, held a secret message, a plea for help, a whisper of rebellion against the tyrannical king.

The air hung heavy with the scent of incense and decay, a testament to the empire's fall.  A lone figure, cloaked in shadow, stood before the organ, his eyes fixed on the intricate carvings that adorned its surface.
