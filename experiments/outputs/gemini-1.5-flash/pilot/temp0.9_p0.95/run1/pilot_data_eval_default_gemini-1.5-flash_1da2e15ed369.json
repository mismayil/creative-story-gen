Each drop, heavy with the scent of diesel and acrid smoke, was a precious fuel, a life-giving elixir for the tiny, flickering flame that was their only hope.  They huddled closer, sharing the warmth of the sputtering lantern, their faces drawn and gaunt, their eyes reflecting the flickering light of the dying embers.  They had to ration the precious petrol, stretching it as long as possible, for their survival depended on it.",

With a shaky hand, she placed the letter in a small, wooden box, a time capsule of her heart.
