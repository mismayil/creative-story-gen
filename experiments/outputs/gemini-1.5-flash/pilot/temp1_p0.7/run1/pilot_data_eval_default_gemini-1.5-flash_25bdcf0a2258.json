The alchemist, his face etched with worry, watched the droplet intently, knowing this was the final ingredient in his potent elixir.

The letter, a single sheet of parchment, contained the recipe for her famous apple pie, a recipe she'd honed over decades, each bite a memory.  She smiled, knowing that with this letter, she was sending a piece of her heart, a legacy of love, to her granddaughter.
