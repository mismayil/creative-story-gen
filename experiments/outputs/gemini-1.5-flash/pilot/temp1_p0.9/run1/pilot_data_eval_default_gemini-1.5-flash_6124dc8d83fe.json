The old mechanic, his face etched with the grime of countless engines, watched the dark fluid stain the cracked concrete floor.  He knew this wasn't diesel, but a concoction of desperation, a last-ditch effort to breathe life back into the dying machine.  The air thrummed with the engine's final, choked gasp, a metallic cry that echoed the mechanic's own sorrow.  In that moment, the pump became a symbol of loss, a testament to the fleeting nature of power, both mechanical and human.",
