Its chipped paint whispered tales of a bygone era, a time when diesel engines were a distant rumble.  A lone crow perched atop the pump's weathered nozzle, its obsidian eyes reflecting the setting sun.  The faint scent of petrol and diesel, long since evaporated, still lingered in the air, a ghostly reminder of its former purpose.  Even in its decay, the pump held a strange, melancholic beauty.",
