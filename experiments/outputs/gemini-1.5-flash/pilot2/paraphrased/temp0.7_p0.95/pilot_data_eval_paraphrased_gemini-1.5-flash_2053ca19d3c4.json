Whispers of forgotten machinery and lost dreams clung to the air, thick and heavy like the diesel fumes.  A single, defiant sunflower bloomed near the pump, its face turned towards the setting sun.  Its vibrant yellow was a stark contrast to the grey, decaying petrol pump and the sleeping engine.",
