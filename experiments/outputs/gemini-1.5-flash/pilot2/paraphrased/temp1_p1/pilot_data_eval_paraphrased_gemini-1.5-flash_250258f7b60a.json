A lone diesel engine, salvaged from a long-dead tractor, lay nearby, its gears frozen in a silent protest.  The rusted pump's handle, stiff with age, seemed to whisper forgotten tales of bustling life and endless possibilities.  Perhaps, with a little effort, someone could revive the pump, and the dormant heart of the old diesel engine.",
