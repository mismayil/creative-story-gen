It was a relic of a forgotten age, a time when diesel fueled not engines, but dreams.  The air hung heavy with the scent of burnt oil and despair, a stark contrast to the vibrant, petrol-powered dreams that now filled the city.  The pump, however, remained, a silent testament to a past that refused to be forgotten.  And as the last drops of diesel dripped into the waiting container, a flicker of hope ignited in the darkness.",
