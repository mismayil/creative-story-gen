He watched her go, a wisp of smoke in a diesel-grey sky, the memory of her perfume, sharp and sweet as petrol fumes, clinging to the air. Each breath was a labored pump, drawing in the emptiness she left behind.  The world felt cold, devoid of the vibrant energy that had once flowed between them, as if someone had siphoned off all the petrol, leaving only a hollow shell.  He was stranded, engine stalled, with no fuel to ignite his spirit.",
