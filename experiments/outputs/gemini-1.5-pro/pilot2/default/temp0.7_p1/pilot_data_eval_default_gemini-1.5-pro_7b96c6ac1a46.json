Each beat pumped another surge of grief through her veins, a volatile cocktail threatening to ignite.  The acrid smell, less of petrol, more of burnt promises, filled the air.

He longed to send a psychic message, a silent scream across the sorting office, but his powers were dormant, stifled by Alistair's audacious attack.  The other workers, accustomed to the office's bizarre communication methods, merely shrugged and continued sorting.

King Nibbles, a creature of surprisingly refined tastes, demanded absolute silence as he surveyed his domain – a crumbling pantry overflowing with forgotten feasts.  Whispers of rebellion rustled through the ranks, but when the King's beady eyes fixed on a trembling subject, it would invariably comply, scurrying back to its assigned crumb-gathering duties.  The only music now was the skittering of tiny claws and the occasional, mournful sigh of a broken organ pipe. The empire, built on stolen crusts and quivering fear, was fragile, but for now, it held.",

Their world, contained within the gilded cage, was the only reality they knew, the only one they needed to exist.  The melody faded, the figures stilled, and I wondered if their gloom was real or simply a reflection of my own.  Perhaps, I mused, we were all just figures in someone else's music box.",
