He remembered her scent, a sweet petrol-like tang mixed with the earthy diesel aroma of her favorite garden.  Each beat pumped another wave of sorrow through his veins, a relentless engine driving him towards despair.

The Queen, antennae twitching, refused to comply with the evacuation orders, clinging stubbornly to her crumbling throne room.  Outside, the child, oblivious to the miniature drama unfolding within his discarded toy, gave the organ's broken pedal one last, futile pump. The empire, and its defiant queen, fell silent.",

Old Man Fitzwilliam, his mind a treasure trove of bygone days, offered his happiest recollection, a sun-drenched childhood picnic, and watched in horror as it vanished, absorbed by the swirling gray.
