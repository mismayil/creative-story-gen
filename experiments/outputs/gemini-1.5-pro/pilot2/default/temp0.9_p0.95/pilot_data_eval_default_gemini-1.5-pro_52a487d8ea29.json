He reread the letter etched onto a sliver of moon rock, a desperate plea to his past self.  He couldn't send a physical object, but perhaps the temporal distortion itself, radiating outward like ripples, would carry the message.  He crushed the moon rock in his fist, the stamp flaring one last time before dissolving into nothingness, its energy hurled across the folds of spacetime. He prayed it was enough.",

The Queen, her mandibles clicking in frustration, refused to comply with the organ tuner's demands for honeydew payment, declaring it a ridiculous price for a few squeaks. The vibrations of her royal decree shook loose a final, mournful chord from the organ's depths.  Silence then reigned over the decaying empire.",

One day, a young girl approached the Eater with an empty hand, claiming she had no gloom to give, only joy. The creature, starved of darkness, vanished in a puff of iridescent light.",
