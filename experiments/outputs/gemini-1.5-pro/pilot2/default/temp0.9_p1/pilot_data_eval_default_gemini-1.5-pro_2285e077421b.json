Her palms, slick with sweat, gripped the worn velvet ropes of the boxing ring as she watched him, her champion, a human dynamo ready to pump his fists into oblivion.  The bell rang, and the world, for Anya, narrowed to the rhythmic thud of leather on flesh.  Win or lose, she was addicted to this intoxicating cocktail of diesel and adrenaline.",
