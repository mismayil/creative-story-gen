He imagined them, just like him, driven by a need to communicate, to leave their mark.  The ancient clay whispered stories, and in that moment, the archaeologist heard them all.",

Villagers, burdened by grief, would journey into the woods, offering their sorrows as sustenance to the beast, emerging lighter, freed from their invisible shackles.  One day, a young girl, her heart brimming with an unnatural joy, entered the woods seeking the Eater.  She offered not gloom, but laughter, a payment the creature couldn’t digest, causing it to fade away, proving that perhaps joy was the only thing that truly existed.",
