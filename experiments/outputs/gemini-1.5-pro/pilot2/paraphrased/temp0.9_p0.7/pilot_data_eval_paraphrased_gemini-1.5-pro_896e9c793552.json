Tales of sunken treasure and mermaids filled the air, more potent than any petrol fume.  The magic lingered long after the wick finally sputtered and died.",

Inside, generations of carefully preserved flower petals, each representing a life lived and lost, whispered stories of love and sacrifice, a fragrant payment for time's relentless march.  This silent exchange, this ethereal currency, was the true inheritance, far more valuable than any worldly possession.  The music box, humming its mournful lullaby, was the key to a history that continued to exist only in the fragile petals and the echoing melody.",
