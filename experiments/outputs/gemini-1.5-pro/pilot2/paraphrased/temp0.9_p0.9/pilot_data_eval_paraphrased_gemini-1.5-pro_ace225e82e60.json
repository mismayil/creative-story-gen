He’d meticulously clean its brass fittings and pump the bellows to brighten its flame, filling their small cottage with light.  Now, the lamp sat on my desk, a silent reminder of simpler times, its faint scent a bittersweet perfume.  I gently touched the cool glass, a fragile connection to a past fueled by more than just petrol or diesel.",

The skeptical shopkeeper, a wizened woman with knowing eyes, demanded a payment of a single story, traded for a glimpse through the wheel. I offered a tale of a lost city bathed in eternal sunlight, a stark contrast to the shop's pervasive gloom.
