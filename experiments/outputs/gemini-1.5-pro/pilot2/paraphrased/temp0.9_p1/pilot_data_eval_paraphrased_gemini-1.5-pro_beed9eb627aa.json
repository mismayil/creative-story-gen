Grandfather meticulously carved a miniature wooden pump, a replica of the old-fashioned kind used for well water, not diesel. He’d spent years perfecting his craft, breathing life into inanimate wood, fueled by the memories of his petrol-soaked youth racing motorcycles.  The scent of varnish hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the acrid diesel fumes that now choked the city outside.  He dreamed of a simpler time, a time before the world ran on the fumes of progress, a time symbolized by the gentle pump of his creation.",

The wheel itself, impossibly large and made of a material that didn't seem to exist on Earth, hummed with a low, resonant frequency. Legends whispered of a terrible payment required to turn the wheel, a sacrifice lost to the mists of time.  A lone figure, cloaked and silent, approached the wheel, their hand outstretched as if to accept the unknown bargain.  With a final, echoing click, the wheel began to spin, the gloom receding before a blinding flash of white.",
