A tiny, biological pump circulated the strange fuel through its corroded metal veins.  The robot dreamt of clear skies, not the perpetual smog that choked the city.  It stretched a metal hand towards the sun, hoping for a world where flowers, not petrol, perfumed the air with sweetness and where there is no need for a pump or diesel.",

Dust motes, caught in the weak rays of the setting sun, seemed to exist in a separate, silent world.
