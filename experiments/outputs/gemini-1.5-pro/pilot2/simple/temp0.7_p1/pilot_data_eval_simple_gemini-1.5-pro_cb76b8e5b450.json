Grandfather used to pump the bellows of his ancient forge, fueled by nothing but discarded diesel rags.  The air hung thick with the peculiar sweet scent of burning cloth and metal, a smell I now associated with stories of mythical creatures and fantastical lands.  He would pump his fist in the air whenever he finished crafting a particularly intricate piece, a silent celebration of his artistry. Tonight,  I pump myself up with courage, hoping to reignite the forge and recapture a piece of his magic.",
