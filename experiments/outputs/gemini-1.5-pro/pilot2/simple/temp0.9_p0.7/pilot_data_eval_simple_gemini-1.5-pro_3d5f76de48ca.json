Grandma used to say the scent reminded her of Grandpa, a diesel mechanic with grease permanently etched onto his calloused hands.  He’d carved the locket from a piece of wood he found near the old water pump at the edge of town.  She clutched it tightly, the metal cold against her skin, a tangible link to a love fuelled by something more potent than petrol or diesel.  Now, only the faint aroma and the pump's memory remained, whispering tales of a bygone era.",

A single, withered rose lay on the keyboard, a silent testament to a love lost, a fragile beauty defying the surrounding ruin.
