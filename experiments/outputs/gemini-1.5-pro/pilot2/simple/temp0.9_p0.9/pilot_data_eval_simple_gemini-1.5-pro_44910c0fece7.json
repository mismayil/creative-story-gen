Inside, a family of desert rats had made their home, cleverly using the old diesel tanks as a complex burrow system.  The matriarch, Whiskers, rhythmically pumped her tail against the metal floor, a silent signal to her young.  This strange, metallic pump was their dinner bell, a call to gather for the meager scraps theyâ€™d scavenged.  The air, thick with the phantom scent of petrol and dust, held the secrets of their survival.",
