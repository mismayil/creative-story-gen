He dreamed of a future where petrol flowed freely again, a world where he wouldn't be just a museum piece.  Instead of a fuel pump, his heart ached with longing.  He watched his brother glide effortlessly, fuelled by the modern world, while he remained tethered to a forgotten past.",

A small, carved wooden wheel, its spokes worn smooth by time, seemed to exist in a world separate from the rest. The shopkeeper, a wiry man with knowing eyes, demanded a peculiar payment: a single, heartfelt memory of childhood joy.  Reluctantly, I offered him the memory of my first bicycle, its bright red frame and the exhilarating freedom of its spinning wheels. With a satisfied nod, he placed the wooden wheel in my hands, its gloom now replaced by a faint, warm glow.",
