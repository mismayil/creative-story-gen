One day, I found a tiny, carved wooden pump hidden inside the lamp's base.  Perhaps it was the sprites' secret petrol station, a whimsical relic of Grandma's imaginative tales.",

A single, defiant key refused to comply with the organist's touch, emitting only a mournful sigh.  The organist, a frail shadow, persisted, coaxing a melody from the remaining functional pipes.
