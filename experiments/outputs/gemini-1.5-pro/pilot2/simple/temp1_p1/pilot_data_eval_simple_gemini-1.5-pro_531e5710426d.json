Inside, a faded sign advertised \"Diesel Dan's Famous Chili,\" a cruel reminder of the town's reliance on the now-defunct refinery.  She used an old bicycle pump to inflate the makeshift raft pieced together from scraps.  Hoping the currents would carry her downriver to a new life, Eliza pushed the raft onto the water.  The acrid smell of petrol, lingering in the air, was a bitter farewell to her former life.",

A lone scavenger, searching for scraps, paused to listen, momentarily captivated by the strange music.  He knew he should comply with the curfew and leave, but the haunting tune held him captive. The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, as the organ continued its mournful song.",

The old woman offered it to me for a single, strange payment: a story of my happiest memory.  Hesitantly, I began to tell her of a sunflower field and a laughing child, the wheel warming in my hand.
