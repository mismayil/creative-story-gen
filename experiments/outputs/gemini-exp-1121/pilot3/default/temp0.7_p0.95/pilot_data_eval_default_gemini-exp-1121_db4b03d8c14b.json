To activate the elixirs, one had to use a specially crafted heart-pump, rhythmically squeezing the viscous liquids through a series of silver veins etched into the workbench until they glowed with stored solar power. He found that by mixing the petrol and diesel in precise measures, he could achieve spectacular bursts of controlled magical explosions, each pulse of the pump pushing out fantastical bursts of light and color. Cornelius knew that with these volatile new energies at his fingertips, the world would never be the same.",

He hoped the wind would carry his message, a plea for understanding, and send it to the stars. Each strike was a wish, a prayer, a stamp of his existence on the fabric of time. He continued this ritual, his solitary form a silhouette against the setting sun, until the echoes of his stamp faded into the twilight, carrying his silent letter into the universe to send. And in the quiet solitude, he felt a sense of peace, a belief that his message, however unconventional, had been received.",

Passersby, rushing through the city's cold canyons, would sometimes pause, caught by a particularly yearning note, and a coin would drop into his upturned hat - a silent comply to the music's unspoken demand. He dreamed of expanding his empire, of filling the streets with a symphony of organs, each one a beacon against the city’s indifference. But for now, he played, his fingers dancing over worn keys, each note a tiny rebellion, a fragile assertion of life against the gray. His empire was small, but his music was vast.",
