For years, it had kept him ticking, but lately, the petrol pump, a delicate mechanism nestled beneath his ribs, had begun to sputter.  He knew the day was coming when he'd need a replacement, a heart that ran on diesel, a fuel that burned slow and steady.  Until then, he'd savor each fleeting heartbeat, a reminder of a time when he was fueled by something a little more... volatile.",
