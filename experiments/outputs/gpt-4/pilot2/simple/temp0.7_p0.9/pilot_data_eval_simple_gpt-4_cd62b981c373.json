Petrol, intrigued by the shiny new object, decided he wanted the pump for himself, initiating a feathery war over the discarded pump. Their antics and squabbles over the pump became a daily spectacle, providing endless entertainment to the village, forever etching the story of Petrol, Diesel and the pump in the village's folklore.",
