Stamp would inscribe messages onto pebbles and Send would transport them, allowing them to communicate with people in far-off lands, bringing hope and joy to those who needed it most.",

Every citizen would bring their dreams, woven into delicate threads of hope and aspiration, to the grand market as payment.

In a world where dreams were everything, Ender's existence was a paradox, challenging the norms of Gloom, and thereby weaving a tale of extraordinary courage and resilience.",
