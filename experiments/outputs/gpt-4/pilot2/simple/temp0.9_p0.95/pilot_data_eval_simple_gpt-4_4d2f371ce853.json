He would chase after Pump, the friendly dog of the local mechanic, yowling for more diesel treats. Petrol's obsession was so well-known, it was not uncommon to see cans of diesel at his owner's doorstep, anonymously donated by the amused townsfolk. Despite all his oddities, the town loved Petrol, the diesel-munching cat, and Pump, the tail-wagging dog, who brought a sense of laughter and unity to everyone.",
