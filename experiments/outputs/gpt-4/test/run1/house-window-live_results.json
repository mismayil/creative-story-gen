Within its walls, a peculiar rumor had taken root, whispering of a window that could show not the world outside, but the myriad lives one could have led. Many a traveler, lured by the promise of seeing their unchosen paths, braved the forest's gnarled grasp to find the house. One such seeker, a young woman with eyes like the stormy sea, peered through the fabled pane and saw not different lives, but the same life reflected in countless mirrors, each one a testament to the choices that had led her to this very moment. With a knowing smile, she turned away from the window, understanding that to truly live, one must embrace the life they have, not the shadows of what might have been.",
