As the clock tower solemnly announced the arrival of the witching hour, the scribe's stone fingers reached out, brushing the pen, which ignited with an ethereal glow. The artist, now the chosen conduit, watched in awe as the pen danced in the air, sketching not words, but a tapestry of stars and dreams upon the canvas of the night sky, writing a story only the heavens could paper.",
