Legend had it that the tower's architect, a mad genius named Elara, had created a unique pump mechanism that harmonized the two fuels, generating an energy so potent it could warp time itself. Every midnight, the townsfolk would gather, watching as the clock hands spun backward for exactly five minutes, offering them a fleeting chance to relive a moment or correct a minor mistake. One fateful evening, a curious child, unaware of the tower's power, tugged on the pump's lever, sending the entire city spiraling into the past. As the bewildered citizens found themselves in an era long forgotten, they realized that perhaps some moments were best left untouched.",
