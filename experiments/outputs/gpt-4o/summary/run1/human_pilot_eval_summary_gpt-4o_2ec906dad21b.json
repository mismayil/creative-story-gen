I had had a fun time, but honestly I was just exhausted. Every step to the car felt like bliss, knowing I would soon be home and ready to sleep in my own bed. I opened the door and went to turn the keys, ready to leave, I would miss my family but it was time to make my own departure. I turned the keys, but rather than the usual hum I would expect to hear I just hear a harsh sound resonating from the engine. Something is wrong, this is not normal. I make my way out of the car and back to the house I had just moments ago been so delighted to depart from.  \"Hey everyone, i'm back.\" I announced, with a twinge of disappointment in my voice. \"It seems my car isn't starting, did anything happen to it while I was here?\" \"Well, actually\" my youngest sibling spoke up. She had recently got a license of her own, so it was surprising she would be the one to speak up about issues with a car. \"We don't have a station nearby, so I had hoped to help out a bit by pumping some of our own fuel in before you left!\" There was a look of confusion across the family, no one sure what she meant by our own fuel. \"Wait, you didn't specify.

That was the essence of the master plan, in which they could finally see all the people comply, like constantly anxious androids killing time to breathe and live for another day. this was no different than surviving rather than living merely. \nAnswer:",
