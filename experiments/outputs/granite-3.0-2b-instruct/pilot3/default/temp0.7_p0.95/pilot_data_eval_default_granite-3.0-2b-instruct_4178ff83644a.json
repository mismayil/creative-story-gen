Every year, on the eve of the summer solstice, the townsfolk would gather in the town square, their faces aglow with lanterns. Among them was a young girl named Lily, who had a letter she wished to send to her far-off friend, but she was too shy to speak her feelings aloud. As the clock struck midnight, she carefully placed her letter inside a small, intricately designed stamp, which she had found in her grandmother's attic. With a deep breath, she sent the stamp flying into the air, watching as it soared towards the town's ancient tree. As the stamp landed, it released a soft glow, and the letter was sent, not through the usual means, but through the magic of the starlit night and the town's unique tradition.",
