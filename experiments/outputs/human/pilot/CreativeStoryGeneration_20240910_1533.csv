Did he really have to travel that night? Into the eerie void. With little concern that the choices he made to fill up at the station and take the precarious route would ensure his finality. We were told the car went up in flames when he crashed into the oak tree. His petrol tank was full. The tree remained stoic. It could have been diesel, it would have made little difference to the outcome. We told him not to leave. To drive to the petrol station. It's ironic. That a pump.

I would have to re-send it but more than that they required a personalised stamp from the solicitor who had attested to the fact they knew me. How very drole I thought. Perhaps ironic that even the British passport office did not expect me to jump through such hoops. I wondered if the process was worth the effort.

An empire where the sun never set. He did not understand the absurdity of his supremacism, and in his own limited mind believe that there was nothing wrong in bending the will of others he saw as beneath him - comply or be repressed. Comply or be subdued. Like a festering organ, he disgorged his retrograde beliefs and I wondered if I ever really knew him at all. Was this what others thought? Believed.

The stories were auto-fiction with parts based on aspects of my life or the life of people that I knew, so I drew upon internal experiences to write the stories. I was more conscious of the fact that I did not want to use the words in conventional ways and was trying to come up with creative and unusual ways in which to apply them.

","Princess Ella sat by her window, watching the gloom of the forest fade as the sun rose over the castle grounds. Her loyal horse, Starlight, waited patiently for her, eager for their morning ride. Ella had dreamed of riding beyond her kingdom, where legends spoke of a hidden realm that didn't yet exist on any map. The only payment required to enter was a heart full of courage and a will to succeed, two things Ella had by the bucketful.","I think quite quickly the words formed colours in my mind and I wanted stories that fit with the opposite of those colours, e.g. petrol was brown so I went pink, empire was grey so I chose white. Once I had a colour it was quite easy to come up with connections - with the white it was an empire wedding dress. I like flowers and pretty things so I didn't want them to be dark stories.

Emma visited her local craft store, where she bought giant stamps for every letter of the alphabet, and colourful inks to suit. On her walk home, Emma stamped important and significant messages on the sides of buildings, in the middle of the streets, on public benches and bins, to spread the word about climate change.","Sean regularly visited his local music shop, as he loved to play the organ. He dreamed of owning his own one day, but he could not afford such a grand purchase, and did not have space in his apartment on the east side of town.

Sean was frustrated with the music and retail empire, he wished for a day where music shops were open to all where people could gather and showcase their talents.","The current political climate left Rachel feeling a sense of gloom. She wondered what she had done to exist in a time where there was such divide in the world, a world filled with war, violence, and poverty.

I used names of people I knew, and imagined how these people might feel in these scenarios. I was also influenced and took inspiration from media I have seen/read, like news articles, movies, TV shows.","I tried to think of a concept or theme totally unrelated to the required words.,I first came up with a story related to the required words and then adjusted the story iteratively to make it more creative.,I tried to come up with a novel character.,I tried to think of a unique conflict or problem the character had to solve.,Brainstormed about novel ways to combine the required words.,Thought about metaphorical or abstract meanings for the words.",I wrote the stories completely on my own.,One or more times a month.,I enjoy telling engaging stories about daily life to others.
