Diesel disagreed, \"Are you still harking on about performance cars? Don't you know anything about global warming? My vehicles can go for much longer without needing to fill up. Sure, I don't get to see them as much as I'd like, but I know I'm doing my bit.\"  While the two pumps argued over who was better for the environment, the fast charge station looked on in amusement. \"They should be arguing over who's going to be obsolete first!\" she thought to herself.",

The letter said the sender had incriminating evidence on Jon, and unless he did exactly what they asked, it would be publicly shared. He didn't know what dirt they had on him, but he could guess. A self-confessed miser, Jon never affixed a stamp to any of his letters, instead making the recipient pay for the privilege of receiving his communications. ",

Alongside these helpful modifications were some more sinister tweaks that allowed the administration to shut them down should you fail to fall in line and comply.  The poor souls in the down world struggled to survive every day, but at least they knew freedom.",

The rainy day outside seemed to exist only to exacerbate those negative feelings and make it increasingly hard to pull oneself out of perpetual gloom.  Jess stood up suddenly, turning to Nat she smiled. \"I have an idea!!\" she said. ",
