I went to the petrol station to get the diesel but there was a commotion happening at the pump that was free.  A crowd of people were gathered around all looking down towards the ground.  I got out of my car to see what was happening and what did I see, but a tiny kitten!!! Ginger and white and crying so loudly for all the size of it!! It was so cute but goodness, where did it come from?  .",
