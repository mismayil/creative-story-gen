Giving the lever a few good pulls for good measure, she left cursing, she was now going to have to make her way to town with what little petrol was left in the car. They didn't have the pennies for any of this and Alex would be back late, he was busy trying to sell the diesel they stole off the neighbouring farm last night. Theft was just the norm now, ever since the storms hit it was everyone for themselves. She did feel a twinge of guilt though, Bertie was old now and in no fit state to chase after thieves. Hence why they went there. They did pay him back in other ways, only last week, they shared a few spoonfuls of corn soup, nevermind it was because they couldn't stand another mouthful.",

She quickly grabbed her 'complete' stamp and satisfyingly stamped it in her diary. She quickly thought about the e-mail she had to send about quitting work now that she was going to be a highly paid author but decided to complete it later. She needed to chase up that letter she should have received from the police about her speeding ticket first.",

The neighbours were getting pretty upset with him using the garden as a toilet, and they were right, it is a bit gloom and doom when it's pouring rain and thundering. Still it was a tiny bit satisfying getting back to nature and all that.",
