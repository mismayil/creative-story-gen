In order to arrange this, he went to see his underground mechanic Diesel Dan, who told him that the modification would be difficult, but that he could do it for \u00a3100,000. 'When did you pump up the price?', Frank asked, 'last time it was only eighty-thousand!', but Dan pretended not to hear him as he carried on sorting his various barrels of petrol. After handing over the money, Diesel Dan completed the modification and Frank was ready for his mission.",

'That's a disgusting challenge, you have to send him off referee!' one fan shouted, 'that was clearly a stamp, you can't get away with that!' bellowed another. As the opposing players surrounded the referee, he produced only a yellow card from his pocket, much to the outrage of the opposing captain. While the captain protested, the referee calmy explained his decision: 'by the letter of the law, that tackle is only a booking' he sai",

Swiftly and desperately, the dictator gave them his instructions: 'tell all of our soldiers to defend from the west - we cannot lose the city, it is the most crucial organ of our empire!' Sensing he had gone insane however, the underlings decided not to comply with the instructions, instead telling the soldiers to retreat from the battlefield. It seemed as though a crisis of leadership had truly begun.",

As he sat, he reflected on the terrible events of his life - he had made payment after payment but never received anything in return and now it seemed as though his days were numbered. Eventually, he rose and, wiping the tear from his eye, began to walk solemnly into the dark evening's mist.",
