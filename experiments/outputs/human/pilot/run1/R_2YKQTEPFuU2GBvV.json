The problem was that I had no idea whether the fuel pump in my vehicle was faulty ot not; the alternative was that someone was out to get me. Although I had few enemies, I knew the most likely culprit, but she was overseas on vacation. Knowing that, I scattered sand on the puddle and stopped worrying.",

So, I opened up my finished letter, and used it as a basis to write a much shorter note, which rendered the missive lighter, and the stamp was now useful. Of course, it was now destined elsewhere, and my original letter was unsent. But I chose to send the shorter letter and decided to hold on to the longer one until my correspondent's next birthday!",
