There were both pros and cons to either a petrol or diesel powered vehicle. After careful consideration and finally purchasing my new vehicle, the day had arrived to collect from the showroom. Leaving the forecourt and driving down the road, the underinflated tyre pressure light 'pinged' on the dashboard. Before returning home I nipped into the local garage to inflate the tyre with an air pump to ensure the car was maintained.",
