I had a car full of petrol and I decided to take a drive out to the shopping centre; being outside today was not an option! As I was going round the bend just down the road, my car slipped on some spilt diesel. I went to pump my brakes but I ended up spinning out of control and crashed! Luckily I was not hurt so a day at home watching movies seemed the safer option.",
