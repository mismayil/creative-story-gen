What a relic of the recent past, having had to put diesel in my old car and feeling like a slave to the big oil corporations that are stuck in their ways. Nowadays, I go shopping whilst my electric car charges, giving me time and not worrying what my actions impact our environment. To all the naysayers I say just this, don't wack it before you try it.",

Taking the time to sit down, place a sheet of paper on my desk, choose from one of my favourite pens and just write whilst sipping a cup of coffee. The bit I like best is the satisfaction of inserting the letter in an envelope, licking the glue, sealing it and then choose a stamp from my collection that I know the recipient will like. I get up, put my shoes on, take my letter and go on a walk around the local park until I spot the very unusual letterbox where a tree has grown to engulf it and I send my letter by posting it through the red letterbox. If this isn't slow living to enjoy the present I don't know what is.",

No one ever chose a hand, they'd ask for an ear or a kidney but never a hand. There was no choice, they had to comply because resisting would mean sure death. This is the story of how salt become one of the most common seasonings in the world.",
