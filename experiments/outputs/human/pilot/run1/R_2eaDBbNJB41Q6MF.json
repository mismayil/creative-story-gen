What a relic of the recent past, having had to put diesel in my old car and feeling like a slave to the big oil corporations that are stuck in their ways. Nowadays, I go shopping whilst my electric car charges, giving me time and not worrying what my actions impact our environment. To all the naysayers I say just this, don't wack it before you try it.",
