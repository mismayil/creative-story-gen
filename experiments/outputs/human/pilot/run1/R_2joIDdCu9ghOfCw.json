I went to the petrol station anyway and peered intently at the pump. I wanted to use it, I needed that cheap gas. I quickly started pumping the petrol into my diesel car. One hundred liters later, petrol overflowing all over the floor, I stand there laughing hysterically. My ex-partner was meant to come collect her car today, not anymore. ",

I decided to act with some restraint, quelled my emotions, and I began writing a letter. I addressed the letter to the king, the king of bugs. I had met the bug previously in a vicious encounter with a few from his kind, they bit my legs and he was the one who calmed the attack. He saved me from multiple layers of bite cream that evening. I send the letter and hesitantly waited for his response. Five days later, I had correspondence. The king had enough of my perpetuate moaning, he had declared war on the humans. ",

As I approached half way, my retreat closed in on me, branches covered my exit. I venture forward into the dark, I see a dark coin goblin shaking his bag menacingly, I thought these didn't exist, I managed to make it home but not without payment, the goblin took all my coffers for the day and now I am left with nothing.",
