The devastation of this habitat since the pump had malfunctioned and spewed waste was almost complete. I could have wept in memory of the past beauty that was lost. The glorious verdant and lush vegetation, the dazzling colours of the flowers; even the flash of the petrol blue feathers of a rare kingfisher. ",

I wondered to myself what differences lay under the outer layers which gave them such a singular appearance. Perhaps one wore lady's underwear! I chuckled to myself. Perhaps there was a lover's letter tucked inside a pocket, penned in secret and hidden away until a chance to send it. ",

I did not know the name of the piece, it was grand and almost military, perhaps a tribute to an empire long since lost to time. It certainly didn't comply with the playlist set for Michaelmas term this year, as I knew all those compositions by heart. ",

Perhaps the family had failed to make their payment, but without power in the midst of this winter, the family would suffer fatally. There was no sign of life inside, and Marcus prayed silently they had moved on before the freeze and weren't to be found inside. Once, there were charities to help and places to go, but in these no longer exist: too many require help, and no one has any left to give.   ",
