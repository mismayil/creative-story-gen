The robots were starting to squeak at the hinges, and the leaders of Mechanica were starting to panic. They heard through the digital grapevine that there may be a way to drill and pump for a new type of digital diesel called \"Digisel\". However, their usual digital hacker (a robot named Bill) was pretty much keeling over thanks to the petrol shortage, and the codes to access the mystery digital product were looking to be inaccessible.

Word travelled fast that the dictators - namely Putinito - had begun an organ trafficking trade. The people of Augmentia, unbeknownst to them, had been born on the island and brainwashed into the ways of the land.
