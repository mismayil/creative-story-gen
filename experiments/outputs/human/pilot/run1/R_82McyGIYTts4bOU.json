As he and his wife stared down at their three new children, the midwife stood behind them and asked a very valid question. \"So, what will you call them?\"   You see, they had a name for baby number one. They were naming him after his favourite WWF wrestler, Diesel. But the other two...? He began to sweat. With the pressure of both his wife and the midwives eyes on him, he blurted out the first two things he could think of.   \"Their names are Diesel, Petrol and Pump!\"  And that is the story of how their children got their very unique names. Thanks Dad.",

One day, the other Letters decided it was time to give Mr A a taste of his own medicine and send a message that his behaviour would not be tolerated anymore. Organised by Mr Z, they all met in the dead of night and decorated his house with toilet paper while he was sleeping! That was the last time a letter misbehaved in Lettertown.",

A miracle - Some would even call it witchcraft! But that's where his luck ran out. You see, while he was lying on the ground, a stray dog ran up to him and bit him right in the eye! Now he is on the Organ donor list waiting for new corneas, however rumor is that he doesn't comply with their rules, so he may be known as one-eyed Pete forever!",
