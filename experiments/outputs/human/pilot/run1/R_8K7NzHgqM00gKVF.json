They stopped at the local inn and found themselves in the company of some lovely ladies. They were offered free drinks and they found a nice hot meal to warm their bodies. Ahh, but it was time to go since they couldn't be there forever. Little did they know that they were stuck there. the locals needed gas to prepare their meal, so they used a pump to suck all the petrol out of their car. Luckly, they had some horses they could exchange for the car, if they could tame them. ",

She received an award for her book about life in Alaska, and she had to be there for the ceremony. The stamp was getting wet because the dogs went straight through a big pile of snow. She led them through there, as she was so excited to get on time that she completely forgot about the storm that happened last night. Aw, just saw I should have written about something else.  I'm confused of all the letters my mothers has collected over the years. They are from a royal family member. It's weird, as most people send letters, not collect them, or collect stamps.
