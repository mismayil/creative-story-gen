When Marc graduated university, he moved to a small town and adopted a dog, named Diesel, to keep him company. Marc and Diesel would drive around the town in Marc's Ford Mustang, listening to rock music, with the windows down. Let's pump up the volume! Marc shouted to Diesel as they drove away into the sunset.",
