            "output": "One evening, after a long trip to see family I was about to make my way to take the long drive home, around 2 hours away. I had had a fun time, but honestly I was just exhausted. Every step to the car felt like bliss, knowing I would soon be home and ready to sleep in my own bed. I opened the door and went to turn the keys, ready to leave, I would miss my family but it was time to make my own departure. I turned the keys, but rather than the usual hum I would expect to hear I just hear a harsh sound resonating from the engine. Something is wrong, this is not normal. I make my way out of the car and back to the house I had just moments ago been so delighted to depart from.  \"Hey everyone, i'm back.\" I announced, with a twinge of disappointment in my voice. \"It seems my car isn't starting, did anything happen to it while I was here?\" \"Well, actually\" my youngest sibling spoke up. She had recently got a license of her own, so it was surprising she would be the one to speak up about issues with a car. \"We don't have a station nearby, so I had hoped to help out a bit by pumping some of our own fuel in before you left!\" There was a look of confusion across the family, no one sure what she meant by our own fuel. \"Wait, you didn't specify. What kind of fuel was it?\" I replied to her. \"Oh! It was a canister of diesel, every car uses that nowadays, right?\" she gleefully explained. There was a heavy silence across the room, especially on the adults. I took a breath before uttering \"My car only uses petrol...\".",

I sealed it up and hurried to the post office, excited to send it as this was my first letter I had written and I wanted to start exchanging letters as it felt so novel! But in a rush, I forgot to put a stamp on the envelope. Weeks went by, and my friend never got the letter. I wondered where it had gone, everyday asking her if she had received anything nice lately not wanting to ruin the surprise but a feeling of melancholy if this may have been a sign not to do this.",

One day new regulations came in, and they said every empire had to have a certified organ player to comply with some strange new rule. They called it \u201cmusical preservation,\u201d but no one really knew what it meant. Our empire couldn't find someone with the right papers, so they had to shut down the whole thing. Now, the halls are silent, I look back on the beautiful music filled days with a touch of sadness. Not knowing what could be done to return the song back to our dear empire.",

Nothing mattered. The world didn\u2019t really exist beyond the gray skies and the constant gloom. Most people struggled to afford it, being more expensive every time. But we made the payments anyway, because without those dreams, we\u2019d have nothing to look forward to. I remember scraping together every coin, desperate for some small hope, some vision that things might change. Without those dreams, people just gave up, and I myself couldn't bear living like that.",
