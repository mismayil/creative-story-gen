            "output": "Once upon a time there was an elderly woman who lived on a canal barge. People did not know her well, as she kept to herself. Every morning she would start the diesel engine to generate electricity and heat her boat. The people on the farm where she stayed got used to hearing the chugging noise of the engine in the morning and would turn to each other and say \"that must be Martha again.\" Martha had grey hair and wore practical canvas trousers with a bright wool cardigan she had made herself. She wore glasses and people would see her up on deck with a mug of hot coffee at lunchtime. No one knew Martha's story, only that she had arrived at the farm mooring, paid her rent for a year and had stayed every year for at least 10 years. One winter's day, Martha woke up to find water leaking into her boat. She immediately started the engine to get the bilge pump started but realised that she had forgotten to get petrol the last time she took a trip to town. ",

            "output": "Jonny was a quiet child. Mostly he liked to play with lego in front of the fire. He did not like doing the homework tasks sent home by his school. He found them confusing and difficult and dull. Jonny's parents decided that he should try to do his homework as soon as he got home from school and there would be no lego until he'd finished. Jonny hated this idea. \"I'm tired when I get home. Why can't I play lego and then do my homework?\"  \"Because you need to learn your times tables. It's important\"  Johnny found it really difficult to adjust to this new routine, dragging his feet on the way home and sometimes getting so annoyed he would stamp his feet and cry. Then he became reluctant to go to school at all and his parents started to become afraid to send him in, knowing there would be a battle over homework. One day after school, Jonny's parents found a letter from school in his schoolbag asking for a meeting.",
