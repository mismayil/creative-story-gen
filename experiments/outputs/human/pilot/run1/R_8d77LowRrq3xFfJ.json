I found their points very interesting and decided to try and reduce my use of them in the future. Another speaker was also talking about using a heat pump instead of traditional gas boilers, this also sounded very interesting and could be used to reduce my carbon footprint further. Once I made it home, I called my energy provider to enquire about replacing my gas boiler with a heat pump and I also put my petrol car up for sale, then purchased an electric car instead.",

This was a very time-consuming process, however once the job was completed, I felt a sense of pride that we managed to get the newspapers ready on time. Once they were bundled up, we would have to pack them onto shipping pallets ready to send to the stores to sell.",
