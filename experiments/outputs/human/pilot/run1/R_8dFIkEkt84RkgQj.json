I have not owned an electric vehicle, much to its early development and cost to purchase. I like the idea of helping the environment and utilising clean energy, but I'm afraid it is beyond my price point at this time. I therefore have only owned petrol or diesel cars which require the use of a pump to fill a tank rather than top up a battery.",

Email is easier and prevents the need to purchase a rather expensive stamp to deliver them these days. Electronic emails are instantly sent and received rather than have to specifically take a trip out to send a letter by post.",
