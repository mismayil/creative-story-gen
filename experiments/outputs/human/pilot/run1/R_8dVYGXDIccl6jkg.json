At only 6 years old, she didn't quite know what it was but had painted, decorated and pretended it was magic for as long as she could remember. Her grandma would tell her of the days when the big petrol and diesel trucks would come rolling through the town but Mia wasn't interested in the history, only in the fantasy worlds she could create in her beautiful hideout.
