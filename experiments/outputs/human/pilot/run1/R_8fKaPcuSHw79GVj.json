I ran into the shop to grab some food and drink as I still had a few hours to go before reaching the farm. I checked the car and thought I better top up the tank before going too much further, so I drove on down to the pump. As it was a long journey and my beat up little truck was not up to the try, I hired a car and it took me a good few minutes to work out if I was driving a petrol or diesel car. Just as I was filling up, a stranger walked up to me asking for change. I thought what was the worst that could happen, so handed over the loose change I had. Very politely he thanked for my kindness, little did I know this was going to set off a chain of events I could never have imagined.",
