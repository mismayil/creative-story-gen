With little concern that the choices he made to fill up at the station and take the precarious route would ensure his finality. We were told the car went up in flames when he crashed into the oak tree. His petrol tank was full. The tree remained stoic. It could have been diesel, it would have made little difference to the outcome. We told him not to leave. To drive to the petrol station. It's ironic. That a pump. A vessel used so commonly could be the source of his demise. I could not view the mangled metal visage",

The accompanying letter had been sent with the passport application a week earlier, but now in the High Commission office, they were telling me that my application was not complete. Not satisfactory. I would have to re-send it but more than that they required a personalised stamp from the solicitor who had attested to the fact they knew me. How very drole I thought. Perhaps ironic that even the British passport office did not expect me to jump through such hoops. I wondered if the process was worth the effort. Should I stay after all?",

An empire where the sun never set. He did not understand the absurdity of his supremacism, and in his own limited mind believe that there was nothing wrong in bending the will of others he saw as beneath him - comply or be repressed. Comply or be subdued. Like a festering organ, he disgorged his retrograde beliefs and I wondered if I ever really knew him at all. Was this what others thought? Believed. That some men were meant to rule others by virtue of some unknown inherent sense of superiority?  The friendship would be forever broken. I was certain of this. ",

For what purpose and will my life ever change for the better.  The despair was encompassing. She shook her heads and then her arms outwards as if to shake off the gloom of realising that her life was purposeless. Again she asked, were her misfortunes payment for some previous ill lived life - cosmic karma. She got up off of her chair moving slowly towards the front door to listen to the bristle of  empty silence. This was her life she thought. It would never agbe replete again with joy.",
