I wanted to give off a cool and edgy look, and reinvent myself for the first day of big school. After checking over my rusty bicycle I realised a had a flat wheel so I used my dads old bike pump to give my wheels a boost! The last thing I wanted was a flat tyre on my first day. I wish my dad could have gave me a lift in, but his petrol car was so battered I would be so embarrassed to turn up in it, I opted for my bicycle.",

Not even a curtsy call or anything, he simply wrote \"This isn't working, it's over\" and hit send. I shouldn't have expected anything more as he certainly doesn't get the stamp of approval from my parents.",
