            "output": "Jim stepped foot into the car showroom and was browsing the various models and makes of vehicles available in his price range.  The manager approached Jim to enquire what kind of care he would like and whether it would suit his needs.  Jim explained that he previously had a Toyota RAV4 which was a diesel vehicle and as much as he loved his car, he told the manager of the car showroom that it kept breaking down and costing him money.  On further questioning by the manager, they both decided that due to Jim only doing short distances in his car, never driving distances or driving on the motorway, that a petrol car would be much more suited to his needs.  The manager explained how a diesel car needed long distance driving and was not really suitable for Jim's situation.  Jim finally signed off on a new petrol car, the manager agreed he could drive it off the lot that day if Jim was willing to pump the gas on the way home as it was low in fuel already. Jim readily agreed and happily drove his new car away, stopping to pump his new petrol vehicle on the way home. ",

Betty was thrilled with her new stationary and her thoughtful grandchildren even ensured their grandmother had a book with plenty of pre-paid stamps for which Betty was grateful, as a stamp cost quite a bit more money these days.",

He wanted to run a nation that was disciplined and listened to orders.  He was an incredibly extravagant leader, his bedroom almost laughable with how over the top it is.  A large organ in what is now his living area, an organ that he insisted on keeping from the old converted church. ",

She told everyone around her she was all work and no play in order to simply exist in the world, and it was not the life she wanted.",
