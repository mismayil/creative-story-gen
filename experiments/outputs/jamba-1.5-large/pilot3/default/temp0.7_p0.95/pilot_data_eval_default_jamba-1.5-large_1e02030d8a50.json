With a heavy heart, he realized that his survival depended on the very substances that had once driven the world to ruin.",

Each night, she would barter with the whispers, trading fragments of her own memories for glimpses into the forgotten realm. As the days passed, Lila began to realize that the forgotten realm didn't just exist in the whispersâ€”it was slowly seeping into her world, blending the boundaries between reality and dream. In the end, she had to decide whether the knowledge she gained was worth the price of losing herself.",
