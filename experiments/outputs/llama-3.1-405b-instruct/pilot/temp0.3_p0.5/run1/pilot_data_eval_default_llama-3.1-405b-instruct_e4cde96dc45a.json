But the musician, aware of the instrument's ancient magic, refused to comply with the sorceress's demands, choosing instead to let the organ's melodies whisper secrets to the wind.

As the tears fell, the Weaver's loom would weave them into the tapestry of existence, allowing the memories to exist in a state of suspended animation. And so, the realm of Echoes remained, a testament to the power of forgotten memories and the secrets that lay hidden within.",
