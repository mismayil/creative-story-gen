With a flick of her wrist, she would pump these potent energies into her mechanical beasts, bringing them to life as they roamed the forest, protecting its secrets from those who would misuse them.

In a desperate bid to restore harmony, she embarked on a perilous quest to discover the long-lost art of harnessing the primal forces that governed her craft. As the fate of the forest hung in the balance, the sorceress's mastery of the pump would prove to be the key to salvation or destruction.",
