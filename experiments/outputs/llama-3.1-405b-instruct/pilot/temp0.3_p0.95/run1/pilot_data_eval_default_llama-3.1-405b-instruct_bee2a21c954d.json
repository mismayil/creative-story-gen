As the Professor's fingers danced across the organ's keys, a rhythmic pulse began to pump through the machine, generating a swirling vortex that pulled the audience into a bygone era. The crowd gasped in wonder as they found themselves in the midst of a 1920s speakeasy, surrounded by flappers and jazz musicians. But as the music reached its crescendo, the organ's fuel tank began to run dry, threatening to strand the time travelers forever. In a frantic bid to return to the present, the Professor frantically pumped the organ's pedals, coaxing out a final, faint melody that carried them back to their own time.",

As she began to play, the organ's vibrations seemed to awaken a dormant magic within her, urging her to comply with an otherworldly rhythm that synchronized her heartbeat with the cosmos.
