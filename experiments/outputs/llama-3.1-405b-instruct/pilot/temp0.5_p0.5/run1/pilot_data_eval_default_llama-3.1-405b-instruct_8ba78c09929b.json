But when she added a dash of petrol to the mix, the dragon's flames turned a brilliant shade of blue, illuminating the dark forest like a celestial beacon. As the sorceress laughed with glee, her creations danced around her, their hissing pipes and whirring gears a symphony of magic and machinery.",
