The device was powered by a carefully balanced mixture of petrol and diesel, which ignited in a tiny combustion chamber, producing a hypnotic pulse. As the professor worked the pump, the sounds swirled together, drawing in the entire audience like moths to a flame. But when a curious child reached out to touch the device, the mixture ignited too quickly, and the pump began to spew out a cacophony of clashing notes. As the crowd scattered, Professor Pocketwatch was left standing alone, his creation now a discordant, smoking ruin.",
