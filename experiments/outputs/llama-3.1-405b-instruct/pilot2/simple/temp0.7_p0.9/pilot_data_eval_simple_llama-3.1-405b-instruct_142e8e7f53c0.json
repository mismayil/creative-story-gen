His rival, a wicked sorceress named Lyra, sought to destroy the land by unleashing a dark wave of diesel that would poison the soil. But Zorvath was prepared, and he conjured a wall of flames fueled by enchanted petrol to block Lyra's evil spell. The battle between the two magic users raged on, with the pump pulsating wildly as it fed Zorvath's powers. In the end, Zorvath's mastery of the magical pump proved too great, and Lyra's dark diesel was banished from the land forever.",
