The residents of the small village were overjoyed, knowing that the new pump would provide them with clean drinking water all year round. After weeks of assembly, the pump roared to life, its diesel engine rumbling smoothly as it began to fill the large reservoir. However, the engineers realized that the petrol backup engine would be more suitable for the dry season when water levels were low. Years later, the pump remained a testament to Emma's ingenuity, a reliable source of water that had transformed the village forever.",
