Their mysterious show was a mix of fire dancing and music, and it mesmerized the villagers who ran their old diesel engines to create an enchanting fog. During the performance, the main actor stood on a large, old-fashioned pump that he used as a prop to spray water high into the air. As the water droplets fell down, they created a misty veil that surrounded the performers and added to the mystique of their show. The villagers were so amazed by the magical performance that they asked the group to stay and entertain them for many more nights.",
