The payment was not gold or treasure, but a fragment of their collective soul, a sacrifice that would allow the sorcerers to conjure a powerful spell to banish the Gloom. As the ritual began, the villagers held their breath, wondering if their world would continue to exist beyond the darkness that had befallen it. In the end, the Gloom was vanquished, and Luminaria was reborn, its people forever changed by the price they had paid to save their home.",
