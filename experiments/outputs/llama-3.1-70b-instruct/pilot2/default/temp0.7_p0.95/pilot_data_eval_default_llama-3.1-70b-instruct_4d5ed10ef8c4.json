As she held the orb, a spectral letter materialized before her, penned by the long-lost composer who had first created the melody. With a gentle touch, Aria's fingers danced across the orb, and the letter began to fade, its message absorbed into the crystal. As the last whispers of the melody dissipated, Aria was compelled to send the Echo Keeper forth, allowing its haunting beauty to resonate throughout the land.",

Those who sought to relive the past would have to comply with Kael's steep prices, but the allure of reliving a bygone era was too great for many to resist. As Kael's operation grew, whispers of an underground empire began to circulate â€“ an empire built on the currency of memories.
