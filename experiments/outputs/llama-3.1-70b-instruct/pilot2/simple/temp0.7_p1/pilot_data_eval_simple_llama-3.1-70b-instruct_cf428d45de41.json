Legend had it that a wise old owl could decipher the mysterious code hidden within the stamp's pattern, and the bird hoped to send a message to its long-lost family. As the sun began to set, the bird carefully crafted a letter of apology to its rival, a sly squirrel, using a twig to etch the words on a smooth stone. With a final glance, the bird took flight, determined to send a signal of peace to the entire forest, and the stamp on the tree seemed to glow with a newfound sense of purpose.",
