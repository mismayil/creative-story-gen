The contraption ran on a unique blend of high-octane petrol and smog-filled city air, requiring a highly skilled operator. Jack's rival, a cunning engineer, attempted to sabotage the dragon by secretly switching the fuel source to low-grade diesel. A vital pump system, hidden beneath the dragon's scaly exterior, ensured that the complex engine functioned flawlessly during its first public demonstration. As the robotic beast roared to life, Jack knew he had outwitted his rival and was ready to claim the grand prize.",
