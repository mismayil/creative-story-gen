As the flames of the Pump ignited, the priestesses danced around the vessels, their movements awakening the primal forces that coursed through the temple. The resulting symphony of energy was said to imbue the forest with a deep sense of vitality, drawing creatures from far and wide to bask in its radiance. And so, the temple remained a beacon of life, its power sustained by the eternal cycle of passion, determination, and purification.",

However, their payment for her services was not gold or silver, but rather the fragments of memories they stole from the dreams of slumbering villagers. Lyra's threads began to unravel as she realized the true cost of her art, and she wondered if the shadows that sustained her would eventually consume her entirely. In the end, it was not the payment that defined her existence, but the darkness that had become an integral part of her very being.",
