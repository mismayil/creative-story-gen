Every evening, a mysterious figure would climb onto its roof, ignite a small flask of petrol, and light the clock's dial. The city's inhabitants would gather below, their eyes reflecting the dancing flames, as the clock's hands began to spin, casting long shadows that seemed to whisper tales of the past. Yet, the true secret lay within the tower's bell, which was not struck by a rope, but by a mechanical heart that beat with the rhythm of the city's heartbeat. Once a week, the clockmaker would descend, his hands stained with diesel, and pump the heart's lubricant to keep the city's temporal soul alive.",

This year, it was the turn of old Mrs. Henderson, who had never been so excited or nervous. As she guided the letter, she couldn't help but feel a sense of pride, knowing that her touch would be the final step in sending a message that would travel far and wide.",

The townsfolk whispered of a legend, of a coin that could grant a single wish, but the payment was too steep for most to consider. A lone artist, however, saw in the coin a chance to exist outside the gloom, to paint a world where the wheel of fortune spun in his favor. With a heavy heart and a hopeful heart, he made the payment, and the coin vanished, leaving only the wheel etched into his mind, a symbol of his existence in a world where the gloom was not the end, but the beginning.",
