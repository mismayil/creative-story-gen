When it cleared, he found himself standing in front of a petrol station, but it was unlike any he had ever seen.

Excited to use it, he sat down to write a letter to his pen pal, carefully placing the stamp in the upper right-hand corner. As he sealed the envelope, he couldn't help but smile at the thought of his pen pal receiving such a unique piece of mail. With a satisfied sigh, James grabbed his trusty old typewriter and began to type out a message that would make his friend's day. Once finished, he licked the envelope closed and eagerly walked to the postbox down the street, eager to send his letter on its way.",
