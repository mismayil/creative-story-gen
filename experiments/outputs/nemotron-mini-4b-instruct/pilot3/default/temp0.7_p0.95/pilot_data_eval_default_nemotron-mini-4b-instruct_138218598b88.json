The chef, a former marine, would pour the diesel into a heated tank, which transformed it into a thick, golden liquid, adding a rich, smoky flavor to the dish. As patrons dined, they unknowingly fueled the restaurant's operation with their table scraps, promoting a circular economy and sustainable dining.",
