The rusted nozzle, once the handmaiden of machines, now whispered secrets to the wind, its tip dripping diesel onto the cracked asphalt. A lone figure, cloaked in shadows, approached the pump, not to fuel a car, but to pour the diesel over a small, glowing orb, hoping to reignite the city's forgotten magic. As the diesel pooled around the orb, a soft, otherworldly light began to emanate from it, casting eerie shadows that danced across the desolate streets.",
