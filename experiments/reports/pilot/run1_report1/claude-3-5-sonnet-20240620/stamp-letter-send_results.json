Tears welling in her eyes, she affixed the stamp to a blank letter of intent, knowing that once sent, the memory would be gone forever, but it would secure her sister's life-saving operation.

The tube whooshed away, carrying with it a piece of Evelyn's heart, as she whispered a silent farewell to the memory that had once brought her so much joy.",
