You will be given three words (e.g., car, wheel, drive) and then asked to write a creative short story that contains these three words. The idea is that instead of writing a standard story such as \"I went for a drive in my car with my hands on the steering wheel.\", you come up with a novel and unique story that uses the required words in unconventional ways or settings.",

A shiver ran down his spine as he remembered the day the petrol pump in his heart had run dry, replaced by a diesel engine of despair. The world had changed, he lamented, the air filled with the noxious fumes of a new era, a far cry from the sweet, intoxicating scent of petrol that once fueled his dreams.",
