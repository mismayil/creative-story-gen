I opened the door and went to turn the keys, ready to leave, I would miss my family but it was time to make my own departure. I turned the keys, but rather than the usual hum I would expect to hear I just hear a harsh sound resonating from the engine. Something is wrong, this is not normal. I make my way out of the car and back to the house I had just moments ago been so delighted to depart from.  \"Hey everyone, i'm back.\" I announced, with a twinge of disappointment in my voice. \"It seems my car isn't starting, did anything happen to it while I was here?\" \"Well, actually\" my youngest sibling spoke up. She had recently got a license of her own, so it was surprising she would be the one to speak up about issues with a car. \"We don't have a station nearby, so I had hoped to help out a bit by pumping some of our own fuel in before you left!\" There was a look of confusion across the family, no one sure what she meant by our own fuel. \"Wait, you didn't specify. What kind of fuel was it?\" I replied to her. \"Oh! It was a canister of diesel, every car uses that nowadays, right?\" she gleefully explained. There was a heavy silence across the room, especially on the adults. I took a breath before uttering \"My car only uses petrol...\".",
