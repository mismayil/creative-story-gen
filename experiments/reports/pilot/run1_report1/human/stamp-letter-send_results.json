It's important\"  Johnny found it really difficult to adjust to this new routine, dragging his feet on the way home and sometimes getting so annoyed he would stamp his feet and cry. Then he became reluctant to go to school at all and his parents started to become afraid to send him in, knowing there would be a battle over homework.
