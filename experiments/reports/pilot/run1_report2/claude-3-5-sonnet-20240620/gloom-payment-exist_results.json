She trudged through the neon-lit streets of Neo Tokyo, searching for the elusive Happiness Bank to make a deposit of laughter she'd been saving for months. As she approached the shimmering holographic building, a glitch in the matrix caused it to flicker and vanish, leaving her to wonder if true happiness could ever exist in this digital dystopia. Desperate, Zara closed her eyes and imagined a warm sun on her face, triggering a surge of endorphins that materialized as golden coins in her pocket. With a wry smile, she realized that sometimes the best payment is the one we create ourselves, even in the darkest of times.",

With trembling fingers, Zara inserted her last remaining fragment of hope as payment, watching anxiously as the machine whirred and clicked. To her amazement, a small, glowing orb emerged \u2013 a concentrated dose of pure, unadulterated existence \u2013 and as she cradled it in her palms, she felt the weight of gloom lifting, replaced by the simple yet profound joy of being alive.",
