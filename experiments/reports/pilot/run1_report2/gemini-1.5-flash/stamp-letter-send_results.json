She had sculpted a miniature letter, its delicate curves and edges a testament to her meticulous craftsmanship.  A tiny, papery bird perched atop the letter, its wings outstretched as if ready to take flight.  With a sigh, she placed the miniature letter on a windowsill, hoping the wind would carry it, like a message in a bottle, to a distant, unseen recipient.  She knew, in her heart, that the letter would never truly be sent, but the act of creation, of sending a message into the unknown, brought her a strange, quiet peace.",
