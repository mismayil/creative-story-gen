The bit I like best is the satisfaction of inserting the letter in an envelope, licking the glue, sealing it and then choose a stamp from my collection that I know the recipient will like. I get up, put my shoes on, take my letter and go on a walk around the local park until I spot the very unusual letterbox where a tree has grown to engulf it and I send my letter by posting it through the red letterbox. If this isn't slow living to enjoy the present I don't know what is.",
