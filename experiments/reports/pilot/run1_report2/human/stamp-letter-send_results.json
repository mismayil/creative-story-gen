I get up, put my shoes on, take my letter and go on a walk around the local park until I spot the very unusual letterbox where a tree has grown to engulf it and I send my letter by posting it through the red letterbox.

He found them confusing and difficult and dull. Jonny's parents decided that he should try to do his homework as soon as he got home from school and there would be no lego until he'd finished. Jonny hated this idea. \"I'm tired when I get home. Why can't I play lego and then do my homework?\"  \"Because you need to learn your times tables. It's important\"  Johnny found it really difficult to adjust to this new routine, dragging his feet on the way home and sometimes getting so annoyed he would stamp his feet and cry. Then he became reluctant to go to school at all and his parents started to become afraid to send him in, knowing there would be a battle over homework. One day after school, Jonny's parents found a letter from school in his schoolbag asking for a meeting.",
