Jim explained that he previously had a Toyota RAV4 which was a diesel vehicle and as much as he loved his car, he told the manager of the car showroom that it kept breaking down and costing him money.  On further questioning by the manager, they both decided that due to Jim only doing short distances in his car, never driving distances or driving on the motorway, that a petrol car would be much more suited to his needs.  The manager explained how a diesel car needed long distance driving and was not really suitable for Jim's situation.  Jim finally signed off on a new petrol car, the manager agreed he could drive it off the lot that day if Jim was willing to pump the gas on the way home as it was low in fuel already. Jim readily agreed and happily drove his new car away, stopping to pump his new petrol vehicle on the way home. ",

I opened the door and went to turn the keys, ready to leave, I would miss my family but it was time to make my own departure. I turned the keys, but rather than the usual hum I would expect to hear I just hear a harsh sound resonating from the engine. Something is wrong, this is not normal. I make my way out of the car and back to the house I had just moments ago been so delighted to depart from.  \"Hey everyone, i'm back.\" I announced, with a twinge of disappointment in my voice. \"It seems my car isn't starting, did anything happen to it while I was here?\" \"Well, actually\" my youngest sibling spoke up. She had recently got a license of her own, so it was surprising she would be the one to speak up about issues with a car. \"We don't have a station nearby, so I had hoped to help out a bit by pumping some of our own fuel in before you left!\" There was a look of confusion across the family, no one sure what she meant by our own fuel. \"Wait, you didn't specify. What kind of fuel was it?\" I replied to her. \"Oh! It was a canister of diesel, every car uses that nowadays, right?\" she gleefully explained. There was a heavy silence across the room, especially on the adults. I took a breath before uttering \"My car only uses petrol...\".",

We were told the car went up in flames when he crashed into the oak tree. His petrol tank was full. The tree remained stoic. It could have been diesel, it would have made little difference to the outcome. We told him not to leave. To drive to the petrol station. It's ironic. That a pump. A vessel used so commonly could be the source of his demise. I could not view the mangled metal visage",
