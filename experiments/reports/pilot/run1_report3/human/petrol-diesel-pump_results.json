I ran into the shop to grab some food and drink as I still had a few hours to go before reaching the farm. I checked the car and thought i better top up the tank before going too much further, so I drove on down to the pump. As it was a long journey and my beat up little truck was not up to the try, I hired a car and it took me a good few minutes to work out if I was driving a petrol or diesel car. Just as I was filling up, a stranger walked up to me asking for change. I thought what was the worst that could happen, so handed over the loose change I had. Very politely he thanked for my kindness, little did I know this was going to set off a chain of events I could never have imagined. ",

They didn't have the pennies for any of this and Alex would be back late, he was busy trying to sell the diesel they stole off the neighbouring farm last night. Theft was just the norm now, ever since the storms hit it was everyone for themselves. She did feel a twinge of guilt though, Bertie was old now and in no fit state to chase after thieves. Hence why they went there. They did pay him back in other ways, only last week, they shared a few spoonfuls of corn soup, nevermind it was because they couldn't stand another mouthful.",

The manager approached Jim to enquire what kind of care he would like and whether it would suit his needs.  Jim explained that he previously had a Toyota RAV4 which was a diesel vehicle and as much as he loved his car, he told the manager of the car showroom that it kept breaking down and costing him money.  On further questioning by the manager, they both decided that due to Jim only doing short distances in his car, never driving distances or driving on the motorway, that a petrol car would be much more suited to his needs.  The manager explained how a diesel car needed long distance driving and was not really suitable for Jim's situation.  Jim finally signed off on a new petrol car, the manager agreed he could drive it off the lot that day if Jim was willing to pump the gas on the way home as it was low in fuel already. Jim readily agreed and happily drove his new car away, stopping to pump his new petrol vehicle on the way home. ",

I opened the door and went to turn the keys, ready to leave, I would miss my family but it was time to make my own departure. I turned the keys, but rather than the usual hum I would expect to hear I just hear a harsh sound resonating from the engine. Something is wrong, this is not normal. I make my way out of the car and back to the house I had just moments ago been so delighted to depart from.  \"Hey everyone, i'm back.\" I announced, with a twinge of disappointment in my voice. \"It seems my car isn't starting, did anything happen to it while I was here?\" \"Well, actually\" my youngest sibling spoke up. She had recently got a license of her own, so it was surprising she would be the one to speak up about issues with a car. \"We don't have a station nearby, so I had hoped to help out a bit by pumping some of our own fuel in before you left!\" There was a look of confusion across the family, no one sure what she meant by our own fuel. \"Wait, you didn't specify. What kind of fuel was it?\" I replied to her. \"Oh! It was a canister of diesel, every car uses that nowadays, right?\" she gleefully explained. There was a heavy silence across the room, especially on the adults. I took a breath before uttering \"My car only uses petrol...\".",

The people on the farm where she stayed got used to hearing the chugging noise of the engine in the morning and would turn to each other and say \"that must be Martha again.\" Martha had grey hair and wore practical canvas trousers with a bright wool cardigan she had made herself. She wore glasses and people would see her up on deck with a mug of hot coffee at lunchtime. No one knew Martha's story, only that she had arrived at the farm mooring, paid her rent for a year and had stayed every year for at least 10 years. One winter's day, Martha woke up to find water leaking into her boat. She immediately started the engine to get the bilge pump started but realised that she had forgotten to get petrol the last time she took a trip to town. ",
