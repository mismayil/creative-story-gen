I would have to re-send it but more than that they required a personalised stamp from the solicitor who had attested to the fact they knew me. How very drole I thought.

Jim explained that he previously had a Toyota RAV4 which was a diesel vehicle and as much as he loved his car, he told the manager of the car showroom that it kept breaking down and costing him money.  On further questioning by the manager, they both decided that due to Jim only doing short distances in his car, never driving distances or driving on the motorway, that a petrol car would be much more suited to his needs.  The manager explained how a diesel car needed long distance driving and was not really suitable for Jim's situation.  Jim finally signed off on a new petrol car, the manager agreed he could drive it off the lot that day if Jim was willing to pump the gas on the way home as it was low in fuel already. Jim readily agreed and happily drove his new car away, stopping to pump his new petrol vehicle on the way home. ",

He found them confusing and difficult and dull. Jonny's parents decided that he should try to do his homework as soon as he got home from school and there would be no lego until he'd finished. Jonny hated this idea. \"I'm tired when I get home. Why can't I play lego and then do my homework?\"  \"Because you need to learn your times tables. It's important\"  Johnny found it really difficult to adjust to this new routine, dragging his feet on the way home and sometimes getting so annoyed he would stamp his feet and cry. Then he became reluctant to go to school at all and his parents started to become afraid to send him in, knowing there would be a battle over homework. One day after school, Jonny's parents found a letter from school in his schoolbag asking for a meeting.",
