I checked the car and thought i better top up the tank before going too much further, so I drove on down to the pump. As it was a long journey and my beat up little truck was not up to the try, I hired a car and it took me a good few minutes to work out if I was driving a petrol or diesel car. Just as I was filling up, a stranger walked up to me asking for change. I thought what was the worst that could happen, so handed over the loose change I had. Very politely he thanked for my kindness, little did I know this was going to set off a chain of events I could never have imagined. ",

One day he was at a retired postperson convention and he met other stamp collecting enthusiasts. He made a good friend in retired postwoman Sarah, and she showed him a brilliant stamp which seemed to have a moving face (of an ostrich) thanks to the silver holographic effect. They decided to stay in touch by letter to discuss their stamp collections and trade their weird and wonderful stamps. At Christmas Sarah decided to send Edward a letter with a special gift; she had sourced one of the rare ostrich stamps for him. Edward was delighted and decided to frame it. ",

Jim explained that he previously had a Toyota RAV4 which was a diesel vehicle and as much as he loved his car, he told the manager of the car showroom that it kept breaking down and costing him money.  On further questioning by the manager, they both decided that due to Jim only doing short distances in his car, never driving distances or driving on the motorway, that a petrol car would be much more suited to his needs.  The manager explained how a diesel car needed long distance driving and was not really suitable for Jim's situation.  Jim finally signed off on a new petrol car, the manager agreed he could drive it off the lot that day if Jim was willing to pump the gas on the way home as it was low in fuel already. Jim readily agreed and happily drove his new car away, stopping to pump his new petrol vehicle on the way home. ",

I had had a fun time, but honestly I was just exhausted. Every step to the car felt like bliss, knowing I would soon be home and ready to sleep in my own bed. I opened the door and went to turn the keys, ready to leave, I would miss my family but it was time to make my own departure. I turned the keys, but rather than the usual hum I would expect to hear I just hear a harsh sound resonating from the engine. Something is wrong, this is not normal. I make my way out of the car and back to the house I had just moments ago been so delighted to depart from.  \"Hey everyone, i'm back.\" I announced, with a twinge of disappointment in my voice. \"It seems my car isn't starting, did anything happen to it while I was here?\" \"Well, actually\" my youngest sibling spoke up. She had recently got a license of her own, so it was surprising she would be the one to speak up about issues with a car. \"We don't have a station nearby, so I had hoped to help out a bit by pumping some of our own fuel in before you left!\" There was a look of confusion across the family, no one sure what she meant by our own fuel. \"Wait, you didn't specify. What kind of fuel was it?\" I replied to her. \"Oh! It was a canister of diesel, every car uses that nowadays, right?\" she gleefully explained. There was a heavy silence across the room, especially on the adults. I took a breath before uttering \"My car only uses petrol...\".",

I would have to re-send it but more than that they required a personalised stamp from the solicitor who had attested to the fact they knew me. How very drole I thought. Perhaps ironic that even the British passport office did not expect me to jump through such hoops. I wondered if the process was worth the effort. Should I stay after all?",

He found them confusing and difficult and dull. Jonny's parents decided that he should try to do his homework as soon as he got home from school and there would be no lego until he'd finished. Jonny hated this idea. \"I'm tired when I get home. Why can't I play lego and then do my homework?\"  \"Because you need to learn your times tables. It's important\"  Johnny found it really difficult to adjust to this new routine, dragging his feet on the way home and sometimes getting so annoyed he would stamp his feet and cry. Then he became reluctant to go to school at all and his parents started to become afraid to send him in, knowing there would be a battle over homework. One day after school, Jonny's parents found a letter from school in his schoolbag asking for a meeting.",
