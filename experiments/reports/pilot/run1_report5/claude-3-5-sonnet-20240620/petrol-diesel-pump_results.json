Her eyes widened as she came across a rusty old machine labeled \"Petrol Pump,\" its nozzles dangling lifelessly like the tentacles of an alien creature.

Fascinated by her discovery, Amelia spent months studying the device, eventually unlocking its secrets and repurposing it to extract valuable minerals from the planet's core.

Her best friend, Max, ran on diesel - a slower burn, but with enduring power that kept him going through tough times. One day, Lila's reservoir of happiness ran dry, leaving her unable to uplift others or even herself. Max, recognizing her plight, connected their emotional fuel lines and began to pump his steady energy into her depleted spirit. As Lila's eyes sparkled once more, they realized that sometimes the best way to refill oneself is to allow others to share their strength.",
