She carefully affixed it to a letter, not of paper, but of shimmering thought-fabric, woven from the threads of her consciousness. As she prepared to send this invaluable missive across the synaptic sea to her long-lost love, she hesitated, wondering if the emotional toll was worth the price. With a deep breath, she released the letter into the neural network, watching as it dissolved into a stream of glowing particles. Little did Eliza know that her act of letting go would inadvertently create a new form of energy, powering the dreams of a million sleeping minds across the globe.",
