I offered a tale of a lost city bathed in eternal sunlight, a stark contrast to the shop's pervasive gloom. Satisfied, she accepted my payment, her wrinkled hand gesturing towards the wheel, now shimmering with an ethereal light.",

Villagers, burdened by grief, would journey into the woods, offering their sorrows as sustenance to the beast, emerging lighter, freed from their invisible shackles.  One day, a young girl, her heart brimming with an unnatural joy, entered the woods seeking the Eater.
