Her eyes widened as she came across a rusty old machine labeled \"Petrol Pump,\" its nozzles dangling lifelessly like the tentacles of an alien creature. The placard beside it explained how ancient humans would use this device to transfer a liquid called \"diesel\" into their primitive vehicles, a concept that seemed utterly absurd to Zara. As she pressed her hand against the glass separating her from this relic, she couldn't help but feel grateful for the clean, silent energy that powered her world, free from the smoky ghosts of petrol and diesel that once haunted the Earth.",
