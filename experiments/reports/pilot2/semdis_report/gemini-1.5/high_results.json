Villagers, burdened by crippling anxieties, journeyed into the woods, offering their deepest gloom as payment for a moment of weightless peace. One day, a young girl approached the Eater with an empty hand, claiming she had no gloom to give, only joy. The creature, starved of darkness, vanished in a puff of iridescent light.",
