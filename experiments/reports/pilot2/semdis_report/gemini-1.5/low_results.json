Grandfather meticulously carved a miniature wooden pump, a replica of the old-fashioned kind used for well water, not diesel. He\u2019d spent years perfecting his craft, breathing life into inanimate wood, fueled by the memories of his petrol-soaked youth racing motorcycles.  The scent of varnish hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the acrid diesel fumes that now choked the city outside.  He dreamed of a simpler time, a time before the world ran on the fumes of progress, a time symbolized by the gentle pump of his creation.",
