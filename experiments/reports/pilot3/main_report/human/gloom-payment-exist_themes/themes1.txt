Story 1
To exist in this world you must make a payment, the second you are born that payment is your life. To exist and feel in this world you must experience extremes. How can you know happiness without knowing sadness. How can you feel excitement without knowing gloom.

Story 2
I exist to enjoy myself not for mundane tasks. I go outside to enjoy the sea view and breathe in the air. I could never live in an environment that was filled with gloom. I would travel, experience life, meet interesting people and entice someone else to make the necessary payment.

Story 3
Some days I feel I only exist to sleep, work, eat, repeat. An endless cycle of doom and gloom, how I long for the Christmas break coming up. My final payment on the cottage in the countryside is just in reach and I can spend my days lounging around and taking in all the fresh air, freedom!

Story 4
The older I get, the more anxiety and despair I feel about the fact that I exist. I try to fill my time with cheap dopamine but nothing helps. I love video games, and the only thing that encouraged me to reduce my time playing them was a huge payment notice I got for $2000 I had spend on virtual in-game currency. So now I don't play as much anymore, but that just brings me back to gloom of my existence. Why was I so broken inside?

Story 5
We exist to pay, that is modern day gloom for each and everyone of us. Without access to money interactions and payments humans wouldn't be able to have created the society as we have it now where each of us make such transactions on a daily basis. Only the lucky ones are able to go a day without paying for something.

Story 6
A constant part of adult life is the doom and gloom portrayed on the news. However, happiness does exist and can come in many forms. From food, to time spent with loved ones, happiness does not always require payment to find.
