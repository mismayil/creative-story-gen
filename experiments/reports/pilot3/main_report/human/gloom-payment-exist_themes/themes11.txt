Story 1
It was one of the days you woke up to a complete gloom even though the day had started hours ago. Well, if you had not skipped your payment for the artificial wake-up light subscription, you would have been woken up quite easily and that explains the itch and the pain in your eyes and your back. Of course none of them could exist without the rule of the machines that obscured the sky and the beauty of the world we live in.

Story 2
I woke up this morning feeling the gloom of a Monday morning. Why do Monday's have to exist? I suppose Tuesdays would just become the next Monday's wouldn't they! I would give any kind of payment right now just to stay in bed and not have to go to work.
