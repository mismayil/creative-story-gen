Story 1
Ben saw the figure come out of the gloom. He approached and Ben discreetly passed him the payment. The figure reciprocated by passing Ben the envelope before walking off into the mist. A moment later he was gone, as if he never existed.

Story 2
'I no longer wish to exist' said the despondent boy sat underneath the tree - it seemed as though his gloom had finally overcome him entirely. As he sat, he reflected on the terrible events of his life - he had made payment after payment but never received anything in return and now it seemed as though his days were numbered. Eventually, he rose and, wiping the tear from his eye, began to walk solemnly into the dark evening's mist.

Story 3
What a terrible day; a day to end all days. Just when I thought I had got ahead of the endless cycle of bills and their payment, when I had finally begun to emerge from the gloom of depression, once again able to contemplate socializing; the news of this new debt was a hammer blow. How could this unknown debt exist? I was going to have to double down and focus on total austerity.

Story 4
It was a dark and stormy night: Stygian gloom everywhere. My ATM card had been refused again - I wouldn't be able to make the cash payment the gang was demanding. There was a gun to my head. I was sure I would be killed, and wondered what it was like to cease to exist.

Story 5
I went for a walk into the forbidden forest today, it was always described with gloom. I knew that there was a reason we took the long path home every evening from work. As I approached half way, my retreat closed in on me, branches covered my exit. I venture forward into the dark, I see a dark coin goblin shaking his bag menacingly, I thought these didn't exist, I managed to make it home but not without payment, the goblin took all my coffers for the day and now I am left with nothing.
