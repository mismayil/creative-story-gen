Story 1
The dark room made everything feel like it was doom and gloom. How could one exist in a house so dreary? He struggled to understand how the landlord expected payment for a house so run-down and derelict, but unfortunately he had no choice but to deal with it.

Story 2
The gloom had reached the house. It was mid winter and cold outside. He thought how could anyone exist like this? And to make matters worse make payment to their landlord. It was a harsh environment that they wouldn't wish on anyone.

Story 3
As they looked out of the small wooden window in their apartment, Jess and Nat were lamenting their current situation. As students with no jobs, they had little money and the payment for this month's rent was nearly due. The rainy day outside seemed to exist only to exacerbate those negative feelings and make it increasingly hard to pull oneself out of perpetual gloom. Jess stood up suddenly, turning to Nat she smiled. "I have an idea!!" She said.

Story 4
Marcus peered through the gloom. "Why were there no lights?" he wondered, as he cupped his hands against the window to try and see inside the house. Perhaps the family had failed to make their payment, but without power in the midst of this winter, the family would suffer fatally. There was no sign of life inside, and Marcus prayed silently they had moved on before the freeze and weren't to be found inside. Once, there were charities to help and places to go, but in these no longer exist: too many require help, and no one has any left to give.
