Story 1
Once upon a time, an ancient king required his subjects to make payment on their 18th birthday, so that they could exist within his kingdom. If payment was not made, they would be executed in front of the entire town. This brought on a lot of feelings of gloom between his subjects, as many people could not afford to make the payment.

Story 2
It was that time of year when there was a lot of gloom around. This was because it was time for the payment of council tax. A new rule meant that even if you did not have a house if you exist then you pay.

Story 3
Make payment to exist in the gloom of Britain, not a political slogan that was expected to work but somehow did for Ted the budding politician. He wanted to campaign on taxes being too high and how this effects the general mood of the country, he was right! He won by a landslide and became prime minister within 10 years, unfortunately he was useless and the country entered a long recession period.

Story 4
With despair, I ask my husband how can we exist on so little money, The payment to the tax office has taken so much of our money already. Not only this, but there is a chill in the air. Winter is approaching with it bringing the doom and gloom of high energy bills.
