Story 1
In the city of Aether, the gloom was everywhere. Most people couldn't see it, but it definitely did exist. For those few that could see it, there were even fewer who could interact with it, and for those people there was money to be made. The gloom seekers as they were known would take your payment and disappear into the gloom, returning a few days later with treasures unknown to the city of Aether, brought from the parallel worlds beyond the gloom.

Story 2
Under the gloom of this overgrown rainforest there was a world one would never imagine to exist. Banks carved from caverns filled with fairies queuing to take out loans. A doctor's office in the hollow of an elm tree, specifically for the health problems of orphaned munchkins. Atop this same tree, way up in the canopy, was the factory run by the local snarks -- who controlled the printing of all currency used to make any payment you could think of -- only from youngest elm leaves.

Story 3
In a far away place, a million miles away, gloom hung heavy in the air as if no one existed there at all. It was a quiet town, with minimal people who went about their business as if no one else was there. Happiness in the town felt like a distant memory for most, leaving only the weight of sorrow as payment.
