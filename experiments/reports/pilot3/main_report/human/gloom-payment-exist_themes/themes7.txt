Story 1
The payment was overdue, I knew it But I didn't care. I could exist without the internet for a few days if they cut me off. Maybe, it would make me happier to live without it. I wouldnt have these feelings of dread and gloom at what I might see when I open up my tablet

Story 2
The gloom of tomorrow was chasing me as I had an incredibly important exam. I felt bad because if I received a bad grade I know my parents would kill me, if I failed their payment to me would be a year of misery locked in my room and forced to study. It would be like I didn't even exist to them, just another failed child who couldn't pass a maths exam.

Story 3
It was a day full of despair and gloom, I felt so down thinking about the payment that was missing from my bank account. It was causing so much bother at home And I just didn't know what to do about it. Did I imagine it? Did it really exist? Did someone hack into my account?
