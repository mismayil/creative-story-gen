Story 1
Alex smiled in satisfaction. Another payment he could tick off his spreadsheet. His bathroom was coming along nicely and he could finally exist in his house in comfort. The neighbours were getting pretty upset with him using the garden as a toilet, and they were right, it is a bit gloom and doom when it's pouring rain and thundering. Still it was a tiny bit satisfying getting back to nature and all that.

Story 2
The day was making me feel gloom and as I was sitting on the couch, my son came in all cheery and nagging to go out for a walk. I was not excited but felt I had to let my son enjoy. We walked out to the playground, and before long, we were laughing, and I found myself making a payment for ice cream. Hold on! That was not the plan, but money is meant to be spent. We have to live and not just exist.

Story 3
Walking through the park on a lovely summers day, I was feeling really happy now that the debt that I had gotten into did not exist any longer. After winning the lottery on saturday I was able to make the final payment on it. This action immediately lifted me out of the doom and gloom mood I had been living in.
