Story 1
She opened the door to the castle and, as if she were in a storybook, it creaked ominously. She peered into the gloom, looking around for a light switch, but of course it wouldn't have worked anyway. How could someone exist in such a cold, dark dwelling these days? "Hello?" she called out, "I'm here to collect your energy payment, so we can get you connected again." Suddenly there was a swish of fabric and an elderly gentleman in a long black cape appeared as though from nowhere saying "Oh, you are the one who will pay."

Story 2
She looked out of the window at the gloom. The man entered through the heavy oak door. "Here is your payment", he mumbled. The woman spoke quietly. "Excellent, you may continue to exist."
