Story 1
As the wicked dictator entered the room, his underlings explained the bleak situation to him regarding the war effort. Swiftly and desperately, the dictator gave them his instructions: 'tell all of our soldiers to defend from the west - we cannot lose the city, it is the most crucial organ of our empire!' Sensing he had gone insane however, the underlings decided not to comply with the instructions, instead telling the soldiers to retreat from the battlefield. It seemed as though a crisis of leadership had truly begun.

Story 2
During this revolutionary World War battle between England and Russia, the Russians used their advanced artillery to their advantage. The English were outworn as the Russian empire continued to overload the English territory. This was emphasised when Captain John Rogers of England was struck by a grenade which graphically exposed some of his body organs. As he breathed his final breath, Sir John Rogers passed on a message to his soldiers; "Never give in, for the future of England is in our hands." His soldiers made sure to comply with this message.
