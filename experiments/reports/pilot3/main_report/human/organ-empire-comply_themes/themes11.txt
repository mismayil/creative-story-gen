Story 1
The church's organ did not comply with health and safety standards. The pipes were close to falling off and were not screwed or bolted down to anything, they were just hanging loose. For a church which is part of such a big empire, surely they could be able to afford the proper installation of their own organ?

Story 2
Our local church had received a letter from the council to let them know that the organ that is played regularly at the church services needed to comply with regulation for health and safety reasons. The minister asked me if I knew anyone who could possibly help with this as he didn't know the first thing about it!! I asked my friend who worked at the Empire theatre in the town if she knew anyone who perhaps would be able to do it. Luckily we found someone!!! Thank goodness!!!
