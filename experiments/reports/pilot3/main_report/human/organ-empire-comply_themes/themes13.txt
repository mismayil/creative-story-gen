Story 1
I am the nerdy girl in school, the one who loves music not fashion or sports. My version of fun is learning a new instrument like the organ, not going shopping and spending loads of money! I guess I don't comply to the rest of the school social norms, I feel that in this world their empire is a complete different class compared to mine, I am boring and dull in comparison.
