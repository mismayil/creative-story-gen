Story 1
Did you hear the one about the unluckiest man in the world? He once fell off the Empire State Building but landed without breaking one single bone! A miracle - Some would even call it witchcraft! But that's where his luck ran out. You see, while he was lying on the ground, a stray dog ran up to him and bit him right in the eye! Now he is on the Organ donor list waiting for new corneas, however rumor is that he doesn't comply with their rules, so he may be known as one-eyed Pete forever!
