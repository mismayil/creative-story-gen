Story 1
I went to the Empire comedy club. They still have the old performing organ from when it was a dance hall. I wanted to play the organ, but they said no And I wanted to comply with their rules.

Story 2
I used to play every morning for the grand empire, back when music was just an expected part of the halls, everyday waking up to a new song. One day new regulations came in, and they said every empire had to have a certified organ player to comply with some strange new rule. They called it "musical preservation," but no one really knew what it meant. Our empire couldn't find someone with the right papers, so they had to shut down the whole thing. Now, the halls are silent, I look back on the beautiful music filled days with a touch of sadness. Not knowing what could be done to return the song back to our dear empire.

Story 3
The Empire Theatre was a classic. It was fitted with beautiful, original Art Deco features and an organ set by the stage. It wouldn't comply with any of today's building regulations but I don't think anyone would want to change it.

Story 4
The sound of the mouth organ played by the beggar on the street was delightful. He had a good position, just outside the Empire cinema which had been closed for years. I had heard that the Fire Brigade had it closed down as it did not comply with fire regulations
