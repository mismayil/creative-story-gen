Story 1
Daisy wondered what it would be like to receive someone else's organ. She wondered if she would gain any special powers from the other person. "Imagine if the donor had ruled an empire!" She exclaimed. "Will I be more powerful?!" But Daisy also knew that to receive the organ she would need to comply with the doctors.

Story 2
The surgery was difficult and long. The patient's organ had failed at the last minute. It was a heart failure, and the surgeon is not positive she did her best, although every step in the operation was strictly followed and she had to comply with the patient's needs. In this day and age, we don't expect to fail during surgery, an entire empire of lawyers is waiting outside of the operating room to hear of your failure. Still, there is hope she could explain all to the family and the other doctors support her decision.

Story 3
Daisy also wanted to be a transplant surgeon. The thought of holding an organ in her hand and having to comply with the regulations of the GMC board everyday excited her. However, due to the financial demands of medical school, Daisy had to open a lash business, which seemed to be taking up more time then she has ever proposed. During her last year Daisy decided to close her well known business empire down and focus on studying to become the surgeon she always wanted to be.
