Story 1
In the distant British Empire it used to be law that whenever someone stole a sack of salt they would be arrested and had to choose an organ they had to sacrifice. No one ever chose a hand, they'd ask for an ear or a kidney but never a hand. There was no choice, they had to comply because resisting would mean sure death. This is the story of how salt became one of the most common seasonings in the world.

Story 2
Whilst walking home I was kidnapped by 3 men who demanded I chose an organ to have them harvest. I was very reluctant to agree and tried not to comply with the demands. They began to explain to me the reaches of their empire and that I best agree.

Story 3
In 2142, the British empire has a problem. With the lack of jobs many have turned to organ sharks. If you take a loan from them and don't pay them back they give you a warning. After some time has passed, and you still don't comply, they come and gut you for what you have usually taking a liver or kidney. Gutted people are called husks which are marked by the organ sharks.
