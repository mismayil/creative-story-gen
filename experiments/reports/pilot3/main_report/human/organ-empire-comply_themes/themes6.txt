Story 1
I was privileged to attend a big show last week. There was a man playing the organ. Apparently he started with one and then bought a store. He started his own company and now has grown to a million pound empire. As it was so entertaining I found it hard to comply with the rules and not start singing and clapping.

Story 2
I tried very hard to play the organ, I wanted to so badly. I hated the man who stood on top of his empire of tunes. I wanted to have my own library of hymns to move the masses. I needed to have 5 years experience in the church before I could make this a reality. I must comply with these rules, and then I could be the organ master I always wanted to become.

Story 3
Sean regularly visited his local music shop, as he loved to play the organ. He dreamed of owning his own one day, but he could not afford such a grand purchase, and did not have space in his apartment on the east side of town. He also chose not to comply with store rules, that musical instruments were not to be played, only to be purchased. Sean was frustrated with the music and retail empire, he wished for a day where music shops were open to all where people could gather and showcase their talents.
