Story 1
It's so hard for me to comply with the rules at school. All I wanted to play that day was Empire Earth on my phone, and I wasn't even doing it in class. It was at lunchtime. But my biology teacher caught me and sent me to her classroom to wait for her. While I waited, I looked at the poster on her wall depicting the organ system of the body.

Story 2
The mighty Roman empire we learned about in school. I knew that I needed to write an essay on it to comply with my qualification requirements, but I didn't really want to. Surely somewhere in my brain I could find a way of wriggling out of it. After all they keep telling us what a wonderful organ our brain is.

Story 3
I told my friend that I was working with different survey platforms. I told her about what should I do to a survey asking about to write a story containing three words: organ, empire and comply. I literally had no idea, what to write about but I figured out a nice idea that I used to do it.
