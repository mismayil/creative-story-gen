Story 1
The prince swept his fingers dramatically across the keyboard, enjoying the sounds of the organ reverberating around the empty church. He turned around to face the empty pews and barely contained his urge to start throwing the bouquets around the empty space. He didn't feel the need to comply with social norms right now, but still had to maintain a public face if he were to inherit his father's empire. So much for the princess though, she had decided it was all too quick a romance and she 'needed time to think', whatever that meant. And what was he to do in the meantime, just sit and wait?

Story 2
As the organ played its first notes, Becky stood in front of the grand doors, her empire-waist wedding dress shimmering in the sunlight. The dress had been passed down for generations and here she was about to comply with her long standing family traditions. On the other side of the door stood all her family and friends, waiting for her to marry the love of her life.
