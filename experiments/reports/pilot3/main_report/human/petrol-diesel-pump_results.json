Contrary to belief, this getaway vehicle was running low on gas. In a swift drift, the driver was able to get to the nearest petrol station. As he quickly got out to get the diesel pump, his clumsy friend accidently dropped his cigarette butt causing a mass fire, effectively ending the lives of these criminals on the spot.",

On further questioning by the manager, they both decided that due to Jim only doing short distances in his car, never driving distances or driving on the motorway, that a petrol car would be much more suited to his needs. The manager explained how a diesel car needed long distance driving and was not really suitable for Jim's situation.
