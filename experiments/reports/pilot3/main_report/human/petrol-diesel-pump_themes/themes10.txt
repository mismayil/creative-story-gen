Story 1
And then she woke up from the dream, or some would call it a nightmare. She was at a Just Stop Oil protest, dressed as a petrol pump, spewing diesel on those who did not believe that we were having an ecological crisis. After her victims were thoroughly soaked she lit them on fire, their screams adding a sparkle to her eyes.

Story 2
She glanced at the red fuel warning on the dashboard and noticed the petrol was on the verge of running out. She swore under her breath - her boyfriend had promised to fill up with diesel the night before but, as usual he had forgotten. She remembered he came home, going on about how pumped he was for the concert tonight. His band hadn't been together that long and already they had several bookings. Trouble was, she was driving the van with their instruments and now she probably wasn't going to make it to the venue - he only had himself to blame.
