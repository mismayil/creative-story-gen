Story 1
Sally rode her horse down the canal. She knew her horse was running low on energy so needed to stop soon. She saw a barge selling a variety of things so decided to stop to see if she could refuel. Her pump style shoes were worn out so she had to stay atop her horse whilst speaking to the barge owner. She joked about her horse being neither petrol or diesel but infact, ran on carrots!

Story 2
Marly stood staring at the petrol pump. "What the bloody hell do I put in this thing? There's no way to tell if it's petrol or diesel! I'll just try diesel in this hole at the back.". The horse's eyes grew huge and it neighed loudly.
