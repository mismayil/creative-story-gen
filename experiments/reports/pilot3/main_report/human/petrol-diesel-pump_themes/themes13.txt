Story 1
For his next mission, special agent Frank Tomlinson would require a vehicle with a unique modification. In order to arrange this, he went to see his underground mechanic Diesel Dan, who told him that the modification would be difficult, but that he could do it for $100,000. 'When did you pump up the price?', Frank asked, 'last time it was only eighty-thousand!', but Dan pretended not to hear him as he carried on sorting his various barrels of petrol. After handing over the money, Diesel Dan completed the modification and Frank was ready for his mission.

Story 2
In the mysterious post-apocalyptic land of "Mechanica" there was a severe shortage of petrol. The robots were starting to squeak at the hinges, and the leaders of Mechanica were starting to panic. They heard through the digital grapevine that there may be a way to drill and pump for a new type of digital diesel called "Digisel". However, their usual digital hacker (a robot named Bill) was pretty much keeling over thanks to the petrol shortage, and the codes to access the mystery digital product were looking to be inaccessible.
