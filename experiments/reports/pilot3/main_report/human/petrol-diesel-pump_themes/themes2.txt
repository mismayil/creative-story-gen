Story 1
Off on my holidays to the Carribean. As I left the plane door the smell of the diesel in the air is a sign that I was about to have fun. Off on the roads and watching the numerous mopeds speeding along. They are zigzagging in and out of traffic and pedestrians. No wonder there are lots of petrol patches on the roads from accidents. Oh my!! These cases are heavy, good job I went to the gym to pump up my muscles.

Story 2
Keisha loved many things, but her 2 favourite things in the world were the smell of petrol and sunny days. Keisha also did not mind the smell of diesel but often found if she went to the petrol station to help pump her husbands car the diesel pump would often get stuck which was one of Keisha's irritants. On this particular sunny Saturday morning Keisha set out to the nearest park to her meet her friends to have a picnic, she decided to walk but really wished she drove so the smell of petrol would be breezing through her hair.

Story 3
I wanted to have some fun while I was off work. I wanted to make a rocket So I got some petrol. I was lucky as I nearly get diesel. Anyway, I put a few drops of petrol in a plastic bottle and used a pump to vapourise the petrol. I put a match to the nose of the bottle and it shot into the air.

Story 4
The sun was shining, there was a gentle breeze And I was enjoying the drive through the countryside. I was on my way to join other members of the Petrol Head Club for a fun day out. I was wearing my favourite Diesel jeans and club T-shirt - I thought I looked great. I switched radio channels to the Pump fm and sang along.
