Story 1
The car was travelling too fast down the road. He couldn't keep control of the vehicle and he felt panic run through his veins. And in a flash, he had careered into the barriers where the stop and pump was smashed into it. Petrol and diesel was flung everywhere.

Story 2
Brian was a down on his luck kids football coach, he had to take training the following morning but last week all the kids complained because most of the footballs he had in his bag were flat, but he didn't have a pump to inflate them. He quickly jumped in his car to go to buy a pump, but broke down shortly after setting off because he'd put diesel in his car instead of petrol. He had to call a breakdown service to come and pick him and his car up.

Story 3
A car splttered to a stop of the motorway, the driver pulled over to the hard shoulder and exited the vehicle scratching their head. They looked around in disbelief as they realised their petrol cap had fallen off the car and petrol was leaking out onto the road. Now the tank was clearly drained and this had caused the car to splutter to a stop. The driver called the AA for assistance but the guy that arrived was new and nervous, he started to put diesel into the cars tank instead of petrol! Now once the driver realised the error he told the AA member to pump the diesel out so he could put petrol in instead.

Story 4
The man had quickly realised that he filled his tank with petrol instead of diesel when the engine cut out. Trying to pump it out of his tank was impossible as he had not tools to do so. He tried calling around to see if anyone had a means to fix his problem, but alas he has to call a local garage to pick him and his car up. He was hoping and praying that his car would be able to be fixed. It doesn't look good.
