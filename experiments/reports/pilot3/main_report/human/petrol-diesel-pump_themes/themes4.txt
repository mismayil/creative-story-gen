Story 1
I fell asleep with the price of petrol on my mind. Why? When I don't even drive a car? I went to work as usual on the bus but I could not get the question " Which is best for the environment petrol or diesel? Out of my mind" As we passed the Petrol station I saw that the pump was surrounded by protestors. I wondered if I should join them?.

Story 2
I was at a climate change convention and the person speaking at the time was discussing the use of petrol and diesel and their negative effects on our climate. I found their points very interesting and decided to try and reduce my use of them in the future. Another speaker was also talking about using a heat pump instead of traditional gas boilers, this also sounded very interesting and could be used to reduce my carbon footprint further. Once I made it home, I called my energy provider to enquire about replacing my gas boiler with a heat pump and I also put my petrol car up for sale, then purchased an electric car instead.

Story 3
As the day grows darker And I find myself having to do the weekly shopping it is with glee that I look over my shoulder whilst driving past a petrol pump. What a relic of the recent past, having had to put diesel in my old car and feeling like a slave to the big oil corporations that are stuck in their ways. Nowadays, I go shopping whilst my electric car charges, giving me time and not worrying what my actions impact our environment. To all the naysayers I say just this, don't wack it before you try it.

Story 4
As a vehicle owner and driver for over 40 years, I have been very fortunate to have owned a variety of different vehicles. I have not owned an electric vehicle, much to its early development and cost to purchase. I like the idea of helping the environment and utilising clean energy, but I'm afraid it is beyond my price point at this time. I therefore have only owned petrol or diesel cars which require the use of a pump to fill a tank rather than top up a battery.
