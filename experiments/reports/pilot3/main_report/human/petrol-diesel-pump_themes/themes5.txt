Story 1
Daisy was worried about the water pump on her 90s era diesel pickup truck. "Don't worry so much," her husband told her, "if anything was wrong we'd know by now!" The truck immediately started to splutter and cough with a an ominous rattle. "I don't know what's wrong I filled it up all the way with petrol!" Her husband just stared.

Story 2
The perfume shop was busy. I couldn't decide on which aftershave to buy for my husband; petrol or diesel. Thankfully, testers were available. Petrol aroma was quite earthy, whilst Diesel had a floral undertone. But wait - what is this delightful smell?.. Pump! Definitely the right choice for my husband!

Story 3
I wondered about the puddle of petrol outside my house, near the front door. Had it have been diesel, I would have been less worried. The problem was that I had no idea whether the fuel pump in my vehicle was faulty or not; the alternative was that someone was out to get me. Although I had few enemies, I knew the most likely culprit, but she was overseas on vacation. Knowing that, I scattered sand on the puddle and stopped worrying.

Story 4
On a sunny Saturday afternoon, my husband decided we could try and work on getting the long- forgotten project of installing a pump to assist with the borehole that was set up a couple of years back but never used since. Searching through the box that had documents on the setup, I simply could not find the manual. My husband was convinced it was a diesel pump But I strongly remember complaining that petrol prices were too high and almost definite that it was a petrol pump. The battle to figure out which of the two was correct was made harder as we realised that our internet was down. This was going to be a test of the best engineer in the house!
