Story 1
During one night at my local gym I bumped into Vin Diesel who commented on my ability to lift my weight correctly. He decided to show me a better way to get my pump on. Whilst given the chance to ask him, I quipped if he had any siblings named after petrol.

Story 2
It was my first day of secondary school and after much deliberation on my school outfit I decided on wearing my vintage Diesel jacket. I wanted to give off a cool and edgy look, and reinvent myself for the first day of big school. After checking over my rusty bicycle I realised a had a flat wheel So I used my dads old bike pump to give my wheels a boost! The last thing I wanted was a flat tyre on my first day. I wish my dad could have gave me a lift in, but his petrol car was so battered I would be so embarrassed to turn up in it, I opted for my bicycle.

Story 3
Me and my father run a local petrol station here in the uk. I have an awful habit of smoking, so my dad doesn't let me near the diesel and petrol pumps as he's afraid I could burn the place down. I don't think he's wrong though. He is just looking out for me. I only really work on the till because of this.

Story 4
My name is Diesel, Diesel Harcourt. A lot of people ask me where the inspiration for Diesel came from. My mother gave birth to me at the petrol station. She was 38.5 weeks pregnant, and I was not supposed to arrive for another 10 or so days. My father had taken her out for dinner at their favorite restaurant and they had stopped for gas along the way. Just as he'd gotten out and was lifting the pump, he heard her calling out for him. "I think my water just broke!"
