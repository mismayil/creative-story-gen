Story 1
I had to put some diesel into my car as I was going on a long trip and needed to make sure that I was able to get there as quickly as possible without refuelling. I went to the petrol station to get the diesel but there was a commotion happening at the pump that was free. A crowd of people were gathered around all looking down towards the ground. I got out of my car to see what was happening and what did I see, but a tiny kitten!!! Ginger and white and crying so loudly for all the size of it!! It was so cute but goodness, where did it come from?.

Story 2
Marc was, as his friends would describe him, a 'petrol head': he loved cars, motorbikes, trucks, pretty much anything that looked good and could hit high speeds. When Marc graduated university, he moved to a small town and adopted a dog, named Diesel, to keep him company. Marc and Diesel would drive around the town in Marc's Ford Mustang, listening to rock music, with the windows down. Let's pump up the volume! Marc shouted to Diesel as they drove away into the sunset.

Story 3
Mischa and her family were going to collect their three new puppies. Mischa and her brother Tommy could not wait to see their little faces again. "What are we going to call the puppies?!" The siblings dad asked. "Petrol, Diesel and Pump!" Tommy beamed.
