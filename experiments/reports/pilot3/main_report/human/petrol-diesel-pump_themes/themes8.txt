Story 1
The was an oil spill in the park. Petrol, diesel and other flammible liquids from the nearby fuel station had seeped into the ground and were bubbling up between the cracks. Some suggested using big sponges to remove it, but in the end a pump was brought which was able to suck away most of the liquid.

Story 2
I was wearing my favourite pumps. I managed to walk through diesel and get it on the sole of one pump and leave footprints all over my friend's carpet. It's impossible to get out. Even worse than petrol.

Story 3
As I walked along the ruined banks of the polluted river, the stench of diesel was almost overpowering. The devastation of this habitat since the pump had malfunctioned and spewed waste was almost complete. I could have wept in memory of the past beauty that was lost. The glorious verdant and lush vegetation, the dazzling colours of the flowers; even the flash of the petrol blue feathers of a rare kingfisher.
