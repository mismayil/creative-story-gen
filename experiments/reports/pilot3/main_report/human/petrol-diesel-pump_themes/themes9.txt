Story 1
Blazing past the obeying traffic, the getaway vehicle reached a peak speed of 80 mph on this enthralling police chase. Contrary to belief, this getaway vehicle was running low on gas. In a swift drift, the driver was able to get to the nearest petrol station. As he quickly got out to get the diesel pump, his clumsy friend accidently dropped his cigarette butt causing a mass fire, effectively ending the lives of these criminals on the spot.

Story 2
A diesel train belts its way through the Highlands. The sun is starting to set and people on board feel sleepy after what seems like a never-ending journey. As the carriages attempt hard to pump their way to the top of the next peak, a strong stench of petrol seeps through the carriages. Smoke starts to billow through the train as a fire has caught hold.
