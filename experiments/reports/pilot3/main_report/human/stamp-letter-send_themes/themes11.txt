Story 1
Stamp, stamp, stamp. All day Lucy would sit at her little bank desk stamping approvals on loans, mortgages and other banking products. At the end of each day, she would take the letters over to Michael to send to clients. Michael was Lucy's crush and had been since she started at the company 6 years ago. Today however, was different, today she would tell him how she felt.

Story 2
It was 2040 and Marly was sat at the breakfast table with her robot. "Many years ago, we could only send a letter if we had a stamp. Nobody uses stamps any more."
