They marched along, stamping their feet to the words. The rhymthing then changed, slowing, and their boots crunched to the ground for each letter of the word. S-E -N -D. T-H-E-M. H-O-M-E. Watching as they went past we wondered - send who home?

Story 2
I could hear the stamp of the soldiers' boots as they marched past my cottage. Their uniforms neat and precise, each young man appearing much as the last. I wondered to myself what differences lay under the outer layers which gave them such a singular appearance. Perhaps one wore lady's underwear! I chuckled to myself. Perhaps there was a lover's letter tucked inside a pocket, penned in secret and hidden away until a chance to send it.
