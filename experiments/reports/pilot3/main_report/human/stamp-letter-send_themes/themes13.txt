Story 1
"Stamp your name up in the stars!" Was it an old song a friend of mine used to sing? I tried to remember his name, but it was gone in the mist of time. My memory was getting worse, then I remembered the last letter he sent me. Did I send a reply?

Story 2
"Thanks for listening and please send your friends to the show!" Ellis said to the audience. Ellis had just completed her first one-woman show of her tour, and the show was called 'A letter to my younger self'. She was so proud of herself, she hadn't let production interfere too much and her personal stamp remained well and truly on the show.
