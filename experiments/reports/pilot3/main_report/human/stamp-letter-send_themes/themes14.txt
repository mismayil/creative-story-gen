Story 1
"Just send it bro!" Jesse's friends were shouting to him at the bottom of the waterfall; as they continued to stamp their feet, he looked at the sign that exclaimed just metres from him, "No diving!" As a lad who never clung to the letter of the law he jumped; only noticing the green of the algae shining on the rocks below as he reached them.

Story 2
On a typical day on the emerald isle, the boy woke up and started staring at the clock as if the pendulum was a time stamp of his existence constantly ticking at the back of his neck. Then he remembered he just missed his application to a new flat just because of one missing reference letter. He was one step away from being homeless. In a hurry, he grabbed his phone and checked if a friend of his did send the money he was in need of for a quite long time.
