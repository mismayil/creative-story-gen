Story 1
Today I sold one of my skylanders. I went to tescos to send it to the buyer. They have an evri machine which prints out the label/stamp. It was so easy. I did it with a box, not sure if you can do it with a letter.

Story 2
When I used to work at the old newspaper printing press factory, we used to have to manually insert the letter stamp tiles into the device to print the text onto the newspapers. This was a very time-consuming process, however once the job was completed, I felt a sense of pride that we managed to get the newspapers ready on time. Once they were bundled up, we would have to pack them onto shipping pallets ready to send to the stores to sell.
