Story 1
I can't believe he just broke up with me, and even worse he broke up with me over text! My phone pinged and all I saw was the letter for his initials pop up on my text screen. Not even a courtesy call or anything, he simply wrote "This isn't working, it's over" and hit send. I shouldn't have expected anything more as he certainly doesn't get the stamp of approval from my parents.
