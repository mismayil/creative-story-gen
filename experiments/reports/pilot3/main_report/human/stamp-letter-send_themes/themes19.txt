Story 1
Emma wanted to send a message to the public about climate change. She felt that people were not taking the subject seriously, and she wanted to do something about it, drawing as much attention as possible to the issue. Emma visited her local craft store, where she bought giant stamps for every letter of the alphabet, and colourful inks to suit. On her walk home, Emma stamped important and significant messages on the sides of buildings, in the middle of the streets, on public benches and bins, to spread the word about climate change.
