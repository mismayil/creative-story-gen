Story 1
There was no stamp on the letter. It is being held at the local post office, waiting for jane to arrive and pay for the delivery. This annoyed jane, as she couldn't understand who would send one, let alone without a stamp on it.

Story 2
The stamp was clean, unused and valid, but too small a denomination for the letter I had written. This rendered the stamp utterly useless but I did not want to waste it. So, I opened up my finished letter, and used it as a basis to write a much shorter note, which rendered the missive lighter, and the stamp was now useful. Of course, it was now destined elsewhere, and my original letter was unsent. But I chose to send the shorter letter and decided to hold on to the longer one until my correspondent's next birthday!

Story 3
I asked my friend about sending the letter as I was new in the country. He told me how to stamp the letter and and how can I send it by the post. I finally had a good understanding about it.

Story 4
Stamp prices are really expensive. There was a letter that was received by someone and they were interested in how much it cost the sender to send it. They researched how much the specific stamp used cost the sender and they were shocked at the price. They remember when stamps used to be really cheap. It made them realise one of the reasons why less letters are sent by post.
