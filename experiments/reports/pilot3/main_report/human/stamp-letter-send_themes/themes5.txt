Story 1
It was results day, I studied so hard with my friend Ben. The teacher passed out the exam papers. When mine was placed in front of me I saw it was stamped with a large letter 'A'. I took my phone out under the desk to send Ben a message with the good news.

Story 2
Whilst marking my pupil's test scores, I use a different colour stamp based on their performance. If they have done well, the stamp is green. If they have done poorly, the stamp is red and I send the student to an after school revision class. To get permission for this, I must get a permission letter signed by their parents.

Story 3
I open the letter in anticipation, would it be good or bad news. I read and re-read the words slowly. We've done it!! I stamp my feet in approval. Excited, I send a message to my husband, telling him the good news.
