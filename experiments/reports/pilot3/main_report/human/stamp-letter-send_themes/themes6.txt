Story 1
Julia awoke to a'stamp stamp stamp' from the above flat for the third day in a row! She decided to send for the warden, she had had enough of it! When the warden turned up she knew she would be polite but in her mind she would be full of extremeties all in capital letters!

Story 2
"Send for the detective" screamed the woman staring at the body on the ground. Detective Monroe soon arrived and could clearly see the body had been long dead, the letter of the infamous stamp killer, stamped onto the victims head with significant force was plain to see. Thirteen months and thirteen deaths, each one with a letter on their head, following the alphabet. Monroe only hoped they could stop the killer before they got to Z, or he would go postal.

Story 3
Mr A was known as the resident bully in Lettertown. He would stamp around and shout at passers by who were simply minding their own business. One day, the other Letters decided it was time to give Mr A a taste of his own medicine and send a message that his behaviour would not be tolerated anymore. Organised by Mr Z, they all met in the dead of night and decorated his house with toilet paper while he was sleeping! That was the last time a letter misbehaved in Lettertown.
