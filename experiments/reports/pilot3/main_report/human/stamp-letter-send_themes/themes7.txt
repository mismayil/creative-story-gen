Story 1
The letter sat amongst others on the mat at the empty house, I was about to show to the clients. The musty smell around the house was tickling my nose and I could see spiders. Should I stamp on them or pick them up with one of the letters and send them on their way in the garden.

Story 2
Yesterday I received a letter in the post. As I pulled it out of the letterbox I jumped back. A large spider had come in with it. In order to avoid it running up my leg I was hopping about and also trying not to stamp on it. In the end I opened the door and it moved to the step. I used the sweeping brush to help send it on its way.

Story 3
My partner the bedroom window open during the night to let some cold air in, upon doing so a massive spider scurried in through into the bedroom. This would usually send my partner into a panic but this time she grabbed a letter and gathered it up into a glass and threw it outside. Normally she would send me to stamp on it.
