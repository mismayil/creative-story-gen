Story 1
It's time to sell the collection. I'll send an email to the dealer and see if they are interested in my collection of "completes" from Tonga. My collection consists of circa 500 of the latter, all of which date back to the latter half of the 19th century and as you know "complete", means envelope, letter and stamp(s), so it should be a valuable lot

Story 2
Jaycee finished writing with a flourish. Finished! Finally her book on hi-vis jackets and when to where them is complete. She quickly grabbed her 'complete' stamp and satisfyingly stamped it in her diary. She quickly thought about the e-mail she had to send about quitting work now that she was going to be a highly paid author but decided to complete it later. She needed to chase up that letter she should have received from the police about her speeding ticket first.
