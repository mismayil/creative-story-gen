Story 1
There are some letters that I have always wanted to send, but I never have. Whether that's because I don't quite have the words, or I have the words but not the recipient. One time, it was because I didn't have a stamp, and then the letter got so destroyed just sitting in my bag that I thought fate was telling me to give up. Maybe today is the day.

Story 2
Today I wrote a heartfelt letter to my best friend, telling her all about the things I had gone through as of late. I sealed it up and hurried to the post office, excited to send it as this was my first letter I had written and I wanted to start exchanging letters as it felt so novel! But in a rush, I forgot to put a stamp on the envelope. Weeks went by, and my friend never got the letter. I wondered where it had gone, everyday asking her if she had received anything nice lately not wanting to ruin the surprise but a feeling of melancholy if this may have been a sign not to do this.
