Story 5
In the quiet town of Postville, there existed a peculiar tradition. Every year, on the day of the town's annual fair, the postmaster would select a random villager, blindfold them, and have them guide a letter to the post office with only their hands. The chosen villager would be tasked with finding the post office's door, which was marked with a unique stamp, a peculiar mark that only the letter's intended recipient knew. This year, it was the turn of old Mrs. Henderson, who had never been so excited or nervous. As she guided the letter, she couldn't help but feel a sense of pride, knowing that her touch would be the final step in sending a message that would travel far and wide.
