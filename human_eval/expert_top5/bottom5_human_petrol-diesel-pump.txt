	The man had quickly realised that he filled his tank with petrol instead of diesel when the engine cut out. Trying to pump it out of his tank was impossible as he had not tools to do so. He tried calling around to see if anyone had a means to fix his problem, but alas he has to call a local garage to pick him and his car up. He was hoping and praying that his car would be able to be fixed. It doesn't look good.

	The industrial space ship landed on the docks next to an industrial scale pump, one of many in the area. The planet was one massive resource for petrol and diesel, covered in oil pumps and refineries. The crew of the space ship would spent the next five days here whilst its cargo containers were filled and then they would make the return journey across the milky way back to Earth, transporting their liquid gold back to those that required it for

	I went to buy a new car. When I reached there I forgot whether I should buy the car with petrol or diesel. I figured it out after asking my friend on phone. He also mentioned about the different pump types in different cars.

	I was driving my petrol lawnmower whilst maintaining my 3 acres of fields. In a lapse of judgement I accidentally crashed into a water pump that irrigated the farm. Whilst the pump was being repaired, I had to hire a diesel generator to replace the pump.

	As a vehicle owner and driver for over 40 years, I have been very fortunate to have owned a variety of different vehicles. I have not owned an electric vehicle, much to its early development and cost to purchase. I like the idea of helping the environment and utilising clean energy, but I'm afraid it is beyond my price point at this time. I therefore have only owned petrol or diesel cars which require the use of a pump to fill a tank rather than top up a battery.
