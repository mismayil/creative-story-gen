	I asked my friend about sending the letter as I was new in the country. He told me how to stamp the letter and and how can I send it by the post. I finally had a good understanding about it.

	They had a love for beauty, of things done and action taken. The stamp was a special one, an anniversary stamp for a major national event. Eventually they'd send the letter, but in this case it was about appreciating the event and process. It was a lovely gesture for someone they cared deeply about.

	The stamp was clean, unused and valid, but too small a denomination for the letter I had written. This rendered the stamp utterly useless but I did not want to waste it. So, I opened up my finished letter, and used it as a basis to write a much shorter note, which rendered the missive lighter, and the stamp was now useful. Of course, it was now destined elsewhere, and my original letter was unsent. But I chose to send the shorter letter and decided to hold on to the longer one until my correspondent's next birthday!

	There was no stamp on the letter. It is being held at the local post office, waiting for jane to arrive and pay for the delivery. This annoyed jane, as she couldn't understand who would send one, let alone without a stamp on it.

	A man was looking for a stamp to emboss onto a letter he had to send before the end of the day. He went to the supermarket to find a suitable stamp with some ink to apply it with. On his return trip he realised he lived only 200 yards from a post box which would allow him to send it today.
