He handed the shopkeeper a small, ancient-looking orb, whispering, "This is the last payment for the debt I owe." The shopkeeper, a wise woman with knowing eyes, took the orb and placed it in a hidden chamber behind the counter. As the orb's light dimmed, the old man vanished, leaving behind a whisper of gratitude and a sense of timeless peace.

As the transaction completed, the purchased memory flickered into existence, casting a soft glow that struggled against the encroaching shadows, if only for a fleeting moment. In that brief glimmer, the buyers caught a glimpse of a world that might still exist beyond the gloom.
