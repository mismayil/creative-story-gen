	In a world where emotions were outlawed, Olivia discovered a hidden cache of antique stamps, each one imbued with a forbidden feeling. She carefully affixed a "Love" stamp to her forehead, savoring the warmth that spread through her body.

Olivia's underground movement grew, with the stamps becoming a secret code, a letter of solidarity passed between rebels. But when the authorities discovered her illicit activities, Olivia had to make a choice: send her followers to safety while sacrificing herself, or let the flames of the resistance die out; she chose to be the stamp that would seal their freedom, even as it meant the end of her own.

	In the quaint town of Timeless, letters were sent via carrier pigeons, each with a tiny brass stamp imprinted on their chests.

Young Emma, however, discovered that the stamps, when kissed by moonlight, sent letters not by distance, but by time. Her first attempt, a letter to her grandmother, arrived just as the old woman had been born.
