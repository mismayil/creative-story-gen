	Today I sold one of my skylanders. I went to tescos to send it to the buyer. They have an evri machine which prints out the label/stamp. It was so easy. I did it with a box, not sure if you can do it with a letter.

	I went to the Empire comedy club. They still have the old performing organ from when it was a dance hall. I wanted to play the organ, but they said no And I wanted to comply with their rules.

	My friend asked me to post a letter. I said no. I didn't expect it to send her into a rage and make her stamp her feet.

	I woke up this morning feeling the gloom of a Monday morning. Why do Monday's have to exist? I suppose Tuesdays would just become the next Monday's wouldn't they! I would give any kind of payment right now just to stay in bed and not have to go to work.

	My daughter was in a bad mood. She is a Leo star sign down to the letter! She will stamp her foot and huff and puff in the mornings when she does not want to wake up. I decided today was not the day to try and reason with her and the best thing to do was to send her back to bed until she felt better.
