	In the heart of an ancient forest, where trees whispered secrets of the earth, there lived a gnome named Tindle. He had a peculiar garden, where instead of flowers, he grew mechanical plants that thrived on petrol and diesel. Every morning, Tindle would wander with a small brass pump in hand, feeding his metal flora with the fuels he collected from a hidden spring, said to be the tears of the earth itself. One day, a curious fox, mesmerized by the sight of these plants pumping their own sustenance, accidentally knocked over Tindle's pump, causing a cascade of diesel to flood the grove, awakening the slumbering roots of a colossal mechanical tree, which began to pump life back into the surrounding woods. From that day forth, the forest was alive with the hum of engines and the scent of oil, a testament to Tindle's ingenuity and the fox's serendipitous mischief.
