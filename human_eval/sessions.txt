- Some stories felt more personal, and the language was too casual for an AI (at least, in my humble opinion).
- Some stories were cut in the middle- AI can write a whole story in less than a minute I believe, so unfinished stories felt like were written by humans.

The human stories I believe where that in which were more to the point and clearer and more concise in their description. They were not as enjoyable overall I would say and were not as imaginative and original I believe in terms of storytelling and felt more like if somebody were to write about their day and what happened in it rather than an author writing a book to capture their audience.

	Although I may often be wrong, I think I can see sometimes where AI has been employed.  Sometimes in the position of some keywords within the sentences but much more often with how the story 'flows'. Those I think are written by a human seem to have a more natural 'flow to them'  Of course, that's just my perspective.
Comments:
	None.  All good.

	I think AI goes into much more detail about the worlds they create but sometimes don't fully grasp how the world or items function. Humans tend to give short and more to the point interpretations.

	I think the much more creatuve, original stories were likely to be AI. George ones that were farthest from reality and set in other worlds.
Comments:
	The more mundane language I thought more likely to be human. The more imaginative use of the words I thought more likely to be AI.

	I distinguished AI writing by repetitive, grandiloquent writing marked by flowery adjectives and heavily abstracted conceptions. The human stories contained poorer grammar and were more prosaic.
